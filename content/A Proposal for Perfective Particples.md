## Introduction

In a sentence with more than one verb, often, grammatical mechanisms are also present to indicate the relationship between the actions denoted by the verbs.
In Kannada, in such cases, if one of the actions happens earlier (in time) than the others, the suffixes `-i` or `-u` are applied on the verb denoting this earlier action ([perfective participle](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/participle/)).

For example,

1. nānu bengaḷūrige `hōgi` bande.
1. railu nildāṇakke `bandu` nintitu.

Here, in `hōgi bande` (`hōgu = go`, `bar/bā = come`), going happens before coming
and in `bandu nintitu` (`bar/bā = come`, `nillu = stand/stop`), comng happens before standing/stopping.

It is the aim of this speculative research article to investigate the origins of these `-i` and `-u` suffixes and how they impart a perfective aspect on verbs.

### Out of Scope

#### Past Tense

The perfective participle to be discussed here is only used to show a relative difference in time between verbs in the same sentence
and not past tense as such.
Kannada uses a different suffix `-d` to indicate past tense; it takes other forms too, like `-t/-ṭ/-ḍ`.
For example, `bande`, `sōtanu`, `biṭṭaru`, `kaṇḍaḷu`, `hōdavu` etc.

So, only the perfective participle that indicates the earlier action among actions indicated by more than one verb in the same sentence is relevant here; not the past tense and its associated suffixes.

#### -al Suffix

Kannada has an `-al` suffix which may sometimes impart a perfective aspect on verbs.
For example, "kr̥ṣṇanu koḷalu `nuḍisalu`, gōvugaḷu baḷige bandavu".
However, on closer observation, such usage rarely has the same subject for all the verbs in the sentence.
In the example above (`nuḍisu = play an instrument, gōvugaḷu = cows, bar/bā = come`), kr̥ṣṇa plays the flute, but it is the cows that come.

But when `-i` or `-u` suffixes are involved, there might be either a single subject or different subjects.
For example,

- Single subject - "`nōḍi` bā". Here (`nōḍu = see, bā = come`), the implicit second-person is the single subject for both the verbs.
- Different subjects - "rāmana kālu `tāki`, ahalyeya śāpa kaḷeyitu". Here (`kālu = leg/foot, tāgu = touch, śāpa = curse, kaḷe = remove/take away`), Rama's leg/foot is what touched, but Ayalya's curse is what got lifted/removed.

Besides, `-al` suffix is used to impart many other meanings on verbs.
For example, in "`nōḍalu` hōgu" (`nōḍu = see, hōgu = go`), `nōḍalu` indicates the intention behind going, neither the completion, nor earlier relative time
of the seeing.

Thus, `-al` suffix in verbs is not relevant here.

## Śabdamaṇidarpaṇa of Kēśirāja 

The relevant verse in [Śabdamaṇidarpaṇa](https://kn.wikipedia.org/wiki/ಕೇಶಿರಾಜ#ಶಬ್ದಮಣಿದರ್ಪಣ) of [Kēśirāja](https://kn.wikipedia.org/wiki/ಕೇಶಿರಾಜ) is as follows.

## Verb forms with -inda suffix in northern dialects of Kannada

Northern dialects of Kannada use, seemingly unique, verb forms with `-inda` suffix.
For example, `māḍinda` is used in various senses like `having done`, `after doing`, `if done then` etc.

- "[nanaga raṅgadamyāga tālīm `māḍinda` hōgudu gottu](https://www.bookbrahma.com/news/naa-kati-kelokanta-beledonu-nandakumar-g-k)".
- "[ildur kūli `māḍinda` yāduk bi sākāgaldu](https://eedina.com/dialects/dialects-of-kannada-aurad-region-bidar-district-ಶಾಳಿ/2023-06-21/)"
- "aṇṇā `hēḷinda` mugītu".

The `-inda` suffix is also found in the `instrumental/ablative` case in nouns.
For example,

- Instrumental, "`ninninda` oḷḷeya kelasavāyitu".
- Ablative, "`maradinda` haṇṇu bittu".

While `-iṁ/-inda/-inde` have traditionally been considered to be `instrumental` suffixes, [Sediyapu Krishna Bhat](https://kn.wikipedia.org/wiki/ಸೇಡಿಯಾಪು_ಕೃಷ್ಣಭಟ್ಟ) has argued,
that they are originally `ablative`.
[Dr. D N Shankara Bhat](http://dnshankarabhat.net) has supported this proposal in his book "[nijakkū haḷegannaḍa vyākaraṇa entahudu?](http://dnshankarabhat.net/ನಿಜಕ್ಕೂ-ಹಳೆಗನ್ನಡ-ವ್ಯಾಕರಣ/)".

> ... ādare, nijakkū ī [iṁ] pratyaya saṁskr̥tada tr̥tīyegiṁtalū paṁcamige hattiravāgide (kr̥ṣṇabhaṭṭa 1992:164 nōḍi). [page 146]

> haḷegannaḍada iṁ pratyaya mukhyavāgi viyōga[=apādāna]vannu sūcisuttadeyallade sahayōga[=karaṇa]vannalla.
adu oṁdu calaneya suruvannu sūcisuva kāraṇa, viyōgavē adara prāmukhyavāda artha... [page 147]

> [Translation: The `iṁ` suffix of Old Kannada mainly indicates separation, rather than cooperation or use[=instrumental].
Since it indicates the start of a movement, seperation is indeed the main meaning.]

Dr. Shankara Bhat's terminology of `separation` for the traditional terminology of the `ablative`, makes the matter easier to understand.
Furthermore, the observation that it indicates the start of a movement (if the context involves some kind of movenent), is very significant for our purposes here.

In the ablative case example "`maradinda` haṇṇu bittu" above,
the ablative form `maradinda` indeed indicates the starting point of the falling (`bīḷu = fall, bittu = fell`).

Besides, I have already argued [elswhere](Provenance%20of%20Pronouns/Provenance%20of%20Pronouns.md#third-person-demonstrative-pronouns-in-kannada-and-their-relationship-to-case-suffixes)
that the origin of the three forms `-iṁ/-inda/inde` of the ablative suffix, the origin of the proximal demonstrative pronouns as well as the second-personal pronouns, is the primitive proximal nasalised base vowel `iṁ/im̐/ɪ̃` and that when it is applied as a suffix, it imparts a sense of separation, i.e. ablative, or start of a movement (in contexts where movement is indicated).

Now if we apply this concept to the `-inda` suffix in some verb forms of the northern dialects of Kannada, it is easy to see how the senses of starting from the action of the verb, after the action of the verb, if the action of the verb happens etc. are produced.

Given that other suffixes like `-ke/-ge`, `-a`, `-al` are found in both noun and verb forms, it is not unexpected that the instrumental/ablative `-inda` is also found in verb forms.

## Perfective participle forms with the -i suffix

[According to Kēśirāja](#śabdamaṇidarpaṇa-of-kēśirāja), verb forms with the suffix `-i` are one of the two forms of the perfective participle.
Also, the verb forms with the `-i` suffix do not have the past tense suffix `-d` or its other forms like `-t/-ṭ/-ḍ`.
For example, `hōgi`, `nōḍi`, `hēḷi` etc.

We have already seen [above](#verb-forms-with--inda-suffix-in-northern-dialects-of-kannada), the verb forms with `-inda` suffix, where the instrumental/ablative case suffix `-inda`, indicating separation or start of movement, applies to verb roots to indicate relatively earlier time or perfective aspect, in the northern dialects of Kannada.
For example, `māḍinda` (`māḍu = do`), is used in not only in the sense of `after doing` or `if done then` but also in the sense of `having done`, as in the perfective participle `māḍi`, which has the `-i` suffix. 

The instrumental/ablative suffix is found in three forms `-iṁ/-inda/inde` in old Kannada.
Of these, though `-iṁ` suffix is not much seen in verb forms of other Kannada dialects, it seems logically fit to be applied to verb roots.
I have already argued [elswhere](Provenance%20of%20Pronouns/Provenance%20of%20Pronouns.md#third-person-demonstrative-pronouns-in-kannada-and-their-relationship-to-case-suffixes)
that the origin of this `-iṁ` suffix and the origin of the proximal demonstrative pronouns as well as the second-personal pronouns, is the same primitive proximal nasalised base vowel `iṁ/im̐/ɪ̃`.

Also, loss of nasalisation is a [natural process](A%20Nose%20for%20Nasalisation.md#nasalisation-disappearing-in-the-instrumental-case-suffix) in Kannada.

Applying both these concepts together results in the `-i` suffix found in perfective participles.
That is,

In ISO 15919,

- `kēḷ/kēḷu + iṁ/im̐`
  - => `kēḷ/kēḷu + i` - Loss of nasalisation
    - => `kēḷi`

In IPA,

- `keːɭ/keːɭu + ɪ̃`
  - => `keːɭ/keːɭu + ɪ` - Loss of nasalisation
    - => `keːɭɪ`

### A Problem

While loss of nasalisation is indeed a natural process in Kannada,
the lack of the corresponding forms with nasalisation or anusvāra, 
like `kēḷiṁ` etc. in Old Kannada,
is a problem for this proposal.
A possible mitigating argument could be that the origin of the suffix is a mere nasalised vowel `im̐/ɪ̃`
and that the non-nasalised `-i` suffix is also found in `alli`,
which is used both as an independent word as well as one of the locative suffixes.

## Perfective participle forms with the -u suffix

Verb forms with the suffix `-u` are the second of the two forms of the perfective participles in Kannada.
Here, the `-u` suffix is always found after the past tense suffix `-d` or one of its other forms like `-t/-ṭ/-ḍ`.
For example, `bandu`, `sōtu`, `biṭṭu`, `kaṅḍu` etc.

As seen [above](#perfective-participle-forms-with-the--i-suffix), given that the `-i` suffix, on its own,
is capable of imparting the sense of separation or start of movement or earlier relative time,
there is no need for the past tense suffix (`-d`) in such forms.
But the `-u` suffix does not seem to able to achieve such a perfective aspect on its own.
Therefore, the standard past tense suffix `-d` or one of its other forms seems to be required before the `-u` suffix to impart the required perfective aspect.

But if the past tense suffix is already applied to impart the perfective aspect,
what is the significance of the `-u` suffix?

There seems to be two possibilities here.

### Aggregating -uṁ/-ū suffix

One possible answer to the question, "What is the significance of the `-u` suffix, if the past tense suffix `-d` or one of its other forms is already applied in the perfective participle?",
could be that it is to present the preceding part of the sentence
and facilitate the further progression of the rest of the sentence with that context.

Presenting parts of the sentence as context for the rest of the sentence is the normal application of the aggregating `-uṁ/-ū` suffix.
It takes the form `-uṁ` (sometimes, `-aṁ` too) in Old Kannada and the form `-ū` in Modern Kannada.
I have argued [elsewhere](Provenance%20of%20Pronouns/Provenance%20of%20Pronouns.md#the-medialpresentative-udu-and-the-aggregating-suffix-uṁ),
that the primitive medial/presentative nasalised base vowel `uṁ/um̐/ũ`
is the origin for this aggregating `-uṁ/-ū` suffix,
as well as the medial/presentative demonstrative pronouns
and in Tamil, even some second-person pronoun forms.

Could this primitive medial/presentative nasalised base vowel `uṁ/um̐/ũ`
also be the origin of the `-u` suffix found in the perfective participle forms?
If this is true, why has the vowel `u` not lengthened into `ū`
while losing the nasalisation,
like in the case of the aggregative `-ū` suffix in Modern Kannada?

I have argued [elsewhere](Provenance%20of%20Pronouns/Provenance%20of%20Pronouns.md#on-the-elongation-of-the-root-vowel-in-the-nominative-and-demonstrative-determiner-forms)
that the reason for the vowel `u` elongating in the aggregating `-ū` suffix,
is to distinguish it from the enunciative vowel `u` that gets typically added to consonant-ending words in Modern Kannada.
But given that verb forms ending only with the past tense suffix `-d` or one of its other forms (that is, with no further suffixes applied)
are not found in Kannada,
it might be possible that the need to distinguish the non-nasalised form of the `-uṁ` suffix from the enunciative vowel `u` may not arise.

#### Problems

While loss of nasalisation is indeed a common process in Kannada
and though corresponding forms with nasalisation or anusvāra,
like `banduṁ` etc. are used in the aggregating sense,
it is a legitimate to ask if it is appropriate to impute
an aggregating sense even to the non-nasalised forms like `bandu`.
But it is not straight-forward to answer.

More importantly, the corresponding forms of these perfective participles in Tamil,
take the unrounded vowel `ŭ` instead of `u`, like `vandŭ` etc.
But the aggregating suffix remains `-uṁ` (with the rounded vowel `u`) in Tamil, just like in Old Kannada.
For example, `nānuṁ`, `nīnuṁ`.

That the unrounded vowel `ŭ` is used in both the presentative as well as proximal pronouns in Tulu, may be a mitigating argument,
but doubt remains about it being a sufficiently clinching argument.

### Enunciative vowel -u

Eminent linguist [Bhadriraju Krishnamurti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhadriraju_Krishnamurti) in his magnum opus, [The Dravidian Languages](https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/The_Dravidian_Languages/fG30nQEACAAJ?hl=en), denoting such forms as the `perfective participle` (page, 330), has called the `-u` (or `-ŭ`, in Tamil) suffix found in them, `enunciative vowels`.

Appending a vowel to enunciate a consonant-ending is a natural process in Dravidian languages.
While Kannada and Telugu use the rounded vowel `u` for this purpose,
Tulu, Tamil and Malayalam use the unrounded vowel `ŭ`.
This aligns well with the forms like `bandu` of Kannada and `vandŭ` of Tamil seen [above](#problems).

As already seen [above](#aggregating--uṁ-ū-suffix), there are no verb forms that end with the past tense suffix `d` or any of its other forms, which are consonant-ending, without any other suffix being applied.
Given that the past tense suffix `-d` or its other forms are all single consonants,
it is natural that any verb forms that might otherwise end with them,
be enunciated with the enunciative vowels.
If this happens, the forms produced are the very same perfective participle forms ending with the `-u` (or `-ŭ` in Tamil) suffix being discussed here.

Thus, it seeems more appropriate (than invoking the aggregating suffix) to say,
that the perfective participle forms ending with the `-u` suffix are,
in fact, the verb roots suffixed with the past tense marker `-d`
or any of its other forms, with the resulting consonant-ending word 
appended with the enunciative vowel `u`.

## A Comparison with Tulu

### From "The Dravidian Languages" of Bhadriraju Krishnamurti

Bhadriraju Krishnamurti, in his magnum opus "The Dravidian Languages",
mentions the perfective participle forms in Tulu, thus.

> 8. Tulu: the perfective participle is formed by adding -tï/-dï, sometimes both, to the verb stem, kal- 'to learn': kal-tï/kal-tïdï 'having learned', tū- 'to see': tūdï 'having seen', bar- 'to come': bat-tï/bat-tïdï 'having come'. [ಪುಟ ೩೩೧]

Though he uses the [close central unrounded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_central_unrounded_vowel) `ï` (or `ɨ` in IPA),
it might as well be the [close back unrounded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_back_unrounded_vowel) `ŭ` (or `ɯ` in IPA).
There is some disagreement among scholars about the precise nature of this vowel in Tulu.
Given that this vowel is also used as an enunciative vowel, much like the 
close back unrounded `ŭ` in Tamil and Malayalam,
let us take it to be the same close back unrounded `ŭ`, for our purposes here.

#### A Small Correction

Here, Badriraju Krishnamurti mentioning that sometimes both `-tŭ/-dŭ` suffixes are applied seems not entirely accurate.
He seems to have given the examples `kalatŭ/kaltŭdŭ`, `battŭ/battŭdŭ` specifically to highlight this phenomenon.

But the first `-tŭ` of the two suffixes here seem to be the 
Tulu version of the standard past tense suffix `-dŭ` or one of its other forms.
Because, the same suffix appears as the past tense marker in the past tense finite forms of the same verbs, such as,
`kalte`, `kaltaḷŭ`, `kalatŭṇḍŭ/kaltŭnŭ`, `batte`, `battaḷŭ`, `battŭṇḍŭ/battŭnŭ` etc.
But in the past tense finite forms of the perfective participle forms with only one of the `-tŭ/-dŭ` suffixes, such as `tūdŭ`,
the past tense suffix does not appear.
For example, `tūye`, `tayaḷŭ`, `tūṇḍŭ`.
This indicates, that the `-dŭ` suffix that comes at the end of the
perfective participle forms, is different from the past tense suffix `-tŭ`,
which sometimes comes before this perfective `-tŭ/-dŭ` suffix.
In the past tense suffix sometimes not appearing in the past tense finite
and perfective participle forms, Tulu seems a bit different from Kannada and Tamil.

The forms that have both the past tense suffix `-tŭ/-dŭ` as well as the
perfective participle suffix `-tŭ/-dŭ`, such as `kaltŭdŭ`, `battŭdŭ`,
indeed have alternative forms where only one of these suffixes remain,
such as `kalatŭ`, `battŭ`.
But this seems to be an example of the consonant/syllable elision that
is routine in Tulu, rather than some grammatical feature.

- `kaltŭdŭ => kalatŭ` - `dŭ` has been elided
- `battŭdŭ => battŭ` - `dŭ` has been elided

But such elision does not occur in the cases like `tūdŭ`,
because, there are not enough syllables there to permit elision.
If elision were indeed to happen, only the verb root `tū` would remain.

### The Tulu perfective participle and the ablative case

Tulu uses the same `-tŭ/-dŭ` suffix to indicate the ablative case.
For example, `marattŭ/marontŭ` (`= from the tree`), `aiḍdŭ/aittŭ` (`=from that`) etc.

Therefore, like in the [case of the `-i` suffix](#perfective-participle-forms-with-the--i-suffix) in some of the perfective participle forms in Kannada,
it might be appropriate to say that the same suffix indicates the separation
or start of a movement or perfective aspect in the ablative noun cases
as well as the perfective participle verb forms, correspondingly.
The only two differences are as follows.

1. While Tulu consistently uses a single suffix (`-tŭ/-dŭ`) in the perfective participle forms,
Kannada uses one of the two suffixes (`-i/-u`).
1. While Tulu always applies the suffix on the past tense forms of the verb,
Kannada does so only in the case of the `-u` suffix
and applies the `-i` suffix directly on the verb root.

It is matter for further research to see if the past tense suffix `-tŭ/-dŭ`
and the ablative suffix (`-tŭ/-dŭ`) are related or if it is a mere coincidence in Tulu.

## Summary

In a sentence with more than one verb, if the action denoted by one of the verbs
happens earlier than those of the others,
the verb of the earlier action takes the perfective participle form.

Kannada uses two mutually exclusive forms for such perfective participles.

1. Forms with the `-i` suffix, like "`hōgi` bā" etc.
Here, the [vowel `i` is indeed a suffix](#perfective-participle-forms-with-the--i-suffix)
and shares the [primitive proximal nasalised base vowel `im̐/ɪ̃`](Provenance%20of%20Pronouns/Provenance%20of%20Pronouns.md#summary-1)
as its origin,
with the `-inda` suffix uniquely found in the [northen dialects of Kannada](#verb-forms-with--inda-suffix-in-northern-dialects-of-kannada), such as `māḍinda`
(in the sense of `having done`, `after doing`, `if done then` etc.),
the [instrumental/ablative suffix forms `-iṁ/-inda/-inde`](Provenance%20of%20Pronouns/Provenance%20of%20Pronouns.md#third-person-demonstrative-pronouns-in-kannada-and-their-relationship-to-case-suffixes) that indicate a separation or start of movement,
the [proximal demonstrative pronouns](Provenance%20of%20Pronouns/Provenance%20of%20Pronouns.md#third-person-pronominal-roots) and the [second-person pronouns](Provenance%20of%20Pronouns/Provenance%20of%20Pronouns.md#second-person-pronominal-roots).
When this primitive proximal nasalised base vowel `im̐/ɪ̃` is applied as a suffix,
it imparts a sense of separation or start of movement or earlier relative time.
Given that it already imparts a sense of earlier relative time,
the standard past tense suffix `-d` would be superflous and hence,
is not found in such forms.

1. Forms with the `-u` suffix, like `bandu` etc.,
which is not just always applied after the past tense suffix `-d` or
one of its other forms,
but also these are the only two suffixes that appear in such forms.
The vowel `u` that appears after the past tense suffix `-d`,
is not really a suffix, but is just the natural [enunciative vowel `u`](#enunciative-vowel--u)
that is commonly used in Kannada to enunciate consonant-ending words.
While the rounded vowel `u` is natural in Kannada for enunciating,
the unrounded `ŭ` is natural in Tamil.

1. Tulu uses a [single `-tŭ/-dŭ` suffix](#the-tulu-perfective-participle-and-the-ablative-case) in all its perfective participle
as well as the ablative noun case forms
and in the perfective participle forms, this suffix is always
applied on the past tense form of the verbs (which may not always have a past tense suffix).
