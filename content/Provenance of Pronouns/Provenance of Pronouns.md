# Provenance of Pronouns

## Background

As [mentioned](Introduction%20and%20Context.md#note) in the [Introduction and Context](Introduction%20and%20Context.md) section,
due to the complexity and subtlety involved in the investigation of the pronoun forms of Kannada and other Dravidian languages,
this document has become unavaoidably detailed and long.
So, for the ease of access, publishing, collaboration, revision tracking as well as for some technical reasons, this document has been split into two parts.
- [Introduction and Context](Introduction%20and%20Context.md) - A brief introduction to the topic and the context for this investigation,
such as a listing of the various pronoun forms in Kannada and other Dravidian languages and highlights of some relevant existing scholarly work can be seen here.
- [Provenance of Pronouns](#provenance-of-pronouns) - The current document.
The actual investigation of pronoun roots of Kannada and other Dravidian languages.
This section refers to the relevant parts from the [Introduction and Context](Introduction%20and%20Context.md) section as required during the investigation of the pronoun roots of Kannada and other Dravidian languages.

## About Transliteration

Kannada and other Dravidian words and word fragments are transliterated in this document using [ISO 15919](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_15919) wherever possible and is unambiguous.
Where ISO 15919 transliteration is unclear or ambiguous, IPA transliteration has also been given alongside the ISO 15919 transliteration.

For example, the [anusvāra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anusvāra) is transliterated as `ṁ` in ISO 15919 but the pronunciation may not be clear because in most dialects of Kannada
This is workable for Kannada words because the pronunciation is fairly clear to most Kannada speakers.
Nasalisation is similarly transliterated as `m̐`  in ISO 15919 but the pronunciation may not be clear to many Kannada speakers because the nasalisation has now been mostly lost in many dialects.
So, to make it clear at least in the transliteration, IPA transliteration (`​̃​ `) has been given alongside the ISO 15919 transliteration (e.g. `am̐`/`ə̃`, `ǣm̐`/`æ̃ː` etc.)

## Third-person Pronominal Roots

### Dravidian Languages

It is not surprising that there is a kind of consensus among scholars regarding the [third-person](https://www.grammar-monster.com/glossary/third_person.htm) pronominal origins in Dravidian languages.
Not only is it easy to see how all the third-person [demonstrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstrative) pronominal forms can be produced from the
demonstrative single vowels, [distal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determiner#Distal_demonstratives) `a`,
[proximal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determiner#Proximal_demonstratives) `i` and the [medial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial#Linguistics) `u`,
but also, the simplicity, beauty and the logical consistency of this system may not surprise the native speakers of Dravidian languages
only because they have naturally inherited it as part of their mother tongue.

All the different third-person demonstrative pronominal forms are produced when grammatical [gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender) and [number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_number) suffixes are appended to these third-person demonstrative pronominal roots.

#### Kannada, Tamil

&nbsp; | `an` (Masculine Singular) | `aḷ` (Feminine Singular) | `du` (Neuter Singular) | `ar` ([Rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_class#Common_criteria_for_noun_classes) Plural) | `vu` (Neuter Plural) | Elongated Vowel ([Demonstrative Determiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstrative#Demonstrative_determiners_and_pronouns))
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
a | avan | avaḷ | adu | avar | avu | ā
i | ivan | ivaḷ | idu | ivar | ivu | ī
u | uvan | uvaḷ | udu | uvar | uvu | ū

Only the [Old Kannada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Kannada) forms have been given here
and Tamil and [Modern Kannada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada#Modern_Kannada) forms have been omitted because very little from these forms.

#### The euphonic infix `v` in the masculine and feminine singular and rational plural forms

The appearance of the [infix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix) `v` in the masculine and feminine singular and rational plural forms (`avan`, `ivaḷ`, `uvar` etc.) needs an explanation.
This is because, normally, when a suffix starting with a vowel (`an`, `aḷ`, `ar` etc.) is appended to a word fragment having an ending vowel,
different euphonic processes might operate to produce forms different from the ones listed above.

For example,

- `a + an => an` - The ending vowel of the preceding fragment drops according to [lōpasaṁdhi](https://kn.wikipedia.org/wiki/ಲೋಪಸಂಧಿ).
- `i + aḷ => iyaḷ` - A euphonic infix `y` appears between the two fragments according to [yakārāgama saṁdhi](https://kn.wikipedia.org/wiki/ಆಗಮ_ಸಂಧಿ#ಯ_ಕಾರಾಗಮ_ಸಂಧಿ).
- `u + ar => uvar` - A euphonic infix `v` appears between the two fragments according to [vakārāgama saṁdhi](https://kn.wikipedia.org/wiki/ಆಗಮ_ಸಂಧಿ#ವ_ಕಾರಾಗಮ_ಸಂಧಿ).

Of these, only the form `uvar' appears in Kannada and Tamil; the other forms don't.

So, some other kind of process is required to explain the appearance of the `v` infix in these forms (`avan`, `ivaḷ` etc.).
A previous research article "[anusvārada anusāra](../ಅನುಸ್ವಾರದ%20ಅನುಸಾರ.md#ಅರ್ಧಅನುಸ್ವಾರದ-ಸ್ವರೂಪ)" proposes such a set of processes (please note that the document is in Kannada and is yet to be translated to English).
In these processes, nasalisation appears to mediate whenever suffixes are appended to roots.
This nasalisation then further transforms into many different forms according to a related set of processes.
Turning into `m` or `v` is among such transforms that the mediating nasalisation enables.
I.e.,

In ISO 15919,
- `a + m̐ + an => am̐ + an => avan`
- `i + m̐ + aḷ => im̐ + aḷ => ivaḷ`

In IPA,
- `ə +  ̃ + ən̪ => ə̃ + ən̪ => əʋən̪`
- `ɪ +  ̃ + əɭ => ɪ̃ + əɭ => ɪʋəɭ`

I have proposed in "[anusvārada anusāra](../ಅನುಸ್ವಾರದ%20ಅನುಸಾರ.md#ಅರ್ಧಅನುಸ್ವಾರದ-ಸ್ವರೂಪ)" that the ending `n` in the masculine singular suffix `an`,
is also really just a nasalisation. 
I.e., `an`/`ən̪` is originally derived from `am̐`/`ə̃`.
In light of this hypothesis, it is easy to see how not just the Old Kannada form of `avan`/`əʋən̪` but also `avam̐`/`əʋə̃` of [Havyaka Kannada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havigannada_dialect) as well as `ava`/`əʋə` (without the trailing `n`) found in some regional spoken dialects of Kannada are produced.

In ISO 15919,
- `a + m̐ + am̐ => am̐ + am̐ => avam̐` - The first nasalisation turns into `v`.
    - `=> ava` - The trailing nasalisation disappear
    - `=> avan` - The trailing nasalisation turns into `n`.

In IPA,
- `ə + ̃ + ə̃ => ə̃ + ə̃ => əʋə̃` - The first nasalisation turns into `v`.
    - `=> əʋə` - The training nasalisation disappears.
    - `=> əʋən̪` - The trailing nasalisation turns into `n̪`.

When a mediating nasalisation can (among other things) turn into `v` or drop off, it wouldn't be incorrect, for the sake of logical consistency,
to invoke the mediating nasalisation even in the forms involving the medial demonstrative pronominal root `u` as well.
I.e.,

In ISO 15919,
- `u + m̐ + ar => um̐ + ar => uvar` - It can be considered that either the nasalisation has disappeared (and the euphonic infix `v` has appeared between `u` and `a` according to vakārāgama saṁdhi) or the nasalisation itself has turned into `v`.

In IPA,
- `u + ̃ + əɾ => ũ + əɾ => uʋəɾ` - It can be considered that either the nasalisation has disappeared (and the euphonic infix `v` has appeared between `u` and `a` according to vakārāgama saṁdhi) or the nasalisation itself has turned into `v`.

The following discussion about neuter gender forms and Tulu third-person pronouns seem to support the case for mediating nasalisation processes.

#### Neuter Gender Forms

Among the neuter gender singular pronominal forms in Kannada, forms ending with `du` (`adu`, `idu`, `udu` etc.) are most common.
Therefore, `du` has been mentioned above as the neuter gender singular suffix.
But there are reasons to think that this is not entirely correct.

For example, the verse [158](https://archive.org/details/abdamaidarpaa00kirjuoft/page/212/mode/2up) of [kēśirāja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesiraja)'s
[śabdamaṇidarpaṇaṁ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabdamanidarpana), mentions the forms `ninatu`, `enatu`, `tanatu` and `ninattu`, `enattu`, `tanattu`
for the common forms `ninnadu`, `ennudu`, `tannadu`.
These alternate forms are no longer found in Modern Kannada.
The suffixes in these forms are `atu`, `attu` and not `adu`.
I.e.,

- `nin + atu => ninatu`
- `en + attu => enattu`

This suggests the possibility of `tu` being the original neuter gender singular suffix,
because `t` transforming into `d` is a natural process in Kannada and Dravidian languages.

The reason for the optional [gemination]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemination) between `atu` and `attu` forms can be found in "[anusvārada anusāra](../ಅನುಸ್ವಾರದ%20ಅನುಸಾರ.md#ಉಕಾರಾಂತವಾದ-ನಪುಂಸಕಲಿಂಗದ-ಏಕವಚನದ-ಸರ್ವನಾಮಗಳ-ಚತುರ್ಥೀ-ವಿಭಕ್ತಿರೂಪಗಳಲ್ಲಿರುವ-ಅಕಾರ-ವಿಕಲ್ಪದ್ವಿತ್ವ)".
As shown above, nasalisation mediating the appending of suffixes to the third-person pronominal roots can explain the the optional gemination between `atu` and `attu`.

In ISP 15919,
- `a + m̐ + tu => am̐tu`
    - `=> atu` - The nasalisation disappears.
    - `=> aṁtu` - Nasalisation turns into [anusvāra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anusvāra) which is pronounced as `n` because it is followed by `t`.
        - `=> attu` - The anusvāra which was pronounced as `n` turns into a gemination of the following consonant `t`.

In IPA,
- `ə + ̃ + t̪u => ə̃t̪u`
    - `=> ət̪u` - The nasalisation disappears.
    - `=> ən̪t̪u` - Nasalisation turns into anusvāra which is pronounced as `n̪` because it is followed by `t̪`.
        - `=> ət̪t̪u` - The anusvāra which was pronounced as `n̪` turns into a gemination of the following consonant `t̪`.

More details about these processes can be seen in "[anusvārada anusāra](../ಅನುಸ್ವಾರದ%20ಅನುಸಾರ.md)"
The fact that other such occurrences of optional gemination of words ending with `tu` surviving in Modern Kannada (`haḷ + atu/attu => haḷatu/haḷattu`, `hos + atu/attu => hosatu/hosattu` etc.) strengthens this argument.

So, *it can be supposed that the neuter gender singular suffix `du` has been derived from the original form `tu`*.
I.e.
- `atu => adu`

But the forms like `ninadu`, `enadu`, `tanadu` do not appear in Kannada; only forms like `ninnadu`, `ennadu`, `tannadu` are found.
The reason for this is another process of "[dvitvasaṁdhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam_grammar#Dvitva_Sandhi_or_%22Rule_of_doubling%22)" which is natural to Dravidian languages, especially to Kannada.
It can be seen that in the word fragments `nin`, `en`, `tan` that appear before `adu`, before the trailing consonant `n` is a single [light syllable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_weight) (`ni`, `e`, `ta`).
Gemination of the trailing consonant (in this case `n`) in such a word fragment, when it is appended with a suffix starting with a vowel,
is a natural process in Kannada which is called dvitvasaṁdhi.
I.e.,

- `nin + adu => ninnadu - DUMdada  (DUM - heavy syllable, da - light syllable)`

I have argued in a previous research article "[vakārada vibhakti](../ವಕಾರದ%20ವಿಭಕ್ತಿ.md)"
(please note that the document is in Kannada and is yet to be translated to English)
that such gemination is one of a set of processes used in Kannada (and other Dravidian languages too to varying extent)
to avoid the `daDUM` rhythm which is unnatural in Kannada (even more so in Modern Kanada) at the beginning of words
(especially, at the beginning of metrical units and sentences).

But `daDUM` rhythm  cannot be seen in the ungeminated form `ninadu` either.
So, the reason for the geminated form `ninnadu` seems to be the nasalisation hidden inside `adu` (which has subsequently disappeared).
That nasalisation, in some production sequences, is capable of producing `dada` or `daDUM` rhythms both of which are unnatural to Kannada.
So, the training consonant `n` gets geminated (`ninnadu`, `ennadu`, `tannadu`) in Kannada to avoid such `dada` or `daDUM` rhythms.
The production sequences could be as follows.

In ISO 15919,
1. `nin + a + m̐ + tu => (nin + a + m̐) + tu => ninnam̐ + tu` - Because `ninam̐` would be in the (undesirable) `dada` rhythm.
    - `=> ninnam̐tu => ninnatu` - The nasalisation disappears.
        - `=> ninnadu` - `t` turns into `d`.

1. `nin + a + m̐ + tu => nin + (a + m̐ + tu) => nin + am̐tu => nin + aṁtu` - `aṁtu` is found in Kannada but with different semantics.
    - `=> nin + aṁdu` - `t` turns into `d`. `aṁdu` is also found in Kannada but with different semantics.
        - `=> ninnaṁdu` - Because `ninaṁdu` (`daDUMda`) would start with the (undesirable) `daDUM` rhythm.
            - `=> ninnadu` - The anusvāra, which is pronounced as `n` here, disappears.

In IPA,
1. `n̪ɪn̪ + ə + ̃ + t̪u => (n̪ɪn̪ + ə + ̃) + t̪u => n̪ɪn̪n̪ə̃ + t̪u` - Because `n̪ɪn̪ə̃` would be in the (undesirable) `dada` rhythm.
    - `=> n̪ɪn̪n̪ə̃t̪u => n̪ɪn̪n̪ət̪u` - The nasalisation disappears.
        - `=> n̪ɪn̪n̪əd̪u` - `t̪` turns into `d̪`.

1. `n̪ɪn̪ + ə + ̃ + t̪u => n̪ɪn̪ + (ə + ̃ + t̪u) => n̪ɪn̪ + ə̃t̪u => n̪ɪn̪ + ən̪t̪u` - `ən̪t̪u` is found in Kannada but with different semantics.
    - `=> n̪ɪn̪ + ən̪d̪u` - `ən̪d̪u` - `t̪` turns into `d̪`. `ən̪d̪u` is also found in Kannada but with different semantics.
        - `=> n̪ɪn̪n̪ən̪d̪u` - Because `n̪ɪn̪ən̪d̪u` (`daDUMda`) would start with the (undesirable) `daDUM` rhythm.
            - `=> n̪ɪn̪n̪əd̪u` - The anusvāra, which was pronounced as `n̪` here, disappears.

More details about these processes can be seen in "[vakārada vibhakti](../ವಕಾರದ%20ವಿಭಕ್ತಿ.md)".

The existance of `ninattu`, `enattu`, `tanattu` forms which start with the (undesirable) `daDum` rhythm, might seem to contradict
the above mentioned processes.
But like the exceptions listed in the same "vakārada vibhakti" article, these exceptional forms are found only in Old Kannada
and have disappeared from Modern Kannada.
This supports the view that the processes related to dvitvasaṁdhi have dominated more in Modern Kannada when compared to Old Kannada.

#### Proximal demonstrative ŭ in Tulu

The argument that there is a nasalisation hidden inside the third-person pronouns finds strong support in the Tulu proximal demonstrative pronouns (`ŭṁbye`, `ŭṁbaḷŭ`, `ŭṁdu` etc.).
Here, the nasalisation appears as full-blown anusvāra which is pronounced as the euphonic nasal consonant of the succeeding consonant.
The `b` that appears in the masculine, feminine singular and rational plural forms (`ŭṁbye`, `ŭṁbaḷŭ`, `ŭṁberŭ` etc.) seems to be
a latter phenomenon that was not present in the root forms.
I.e.,

In ISO 15919,
- `ŭ + m̐ + e` - `e` seems to be the root masculine singular suffix in Tulu.
    - `=> ŭṁ + ye` - The nasalisation turns into anusvāra which is pronounced here as `m`
    and an euphonic `y` has infixed before `e`.
        - `=> ŭṁye` - The anusvāra is pronounced here as `m`, `ŭmye`.
            - `=> ŭṁbye` - Pronounced `ŭmbye`.
- `ŭ + m̐ + aḷŭ` - As in other Dravidian languages, `aḷŭ` is a feminine singular suffix in Tulu too.
    - `=> ŭṁ + aḷŭ` - The nasalisation turns into anusvāra which is pronounced here as `m`.
        - `=> ŭṁaḷŭ` - The anusvāra is pronounced here as `m`, `ŭmaḷŭ`.
            - `=> ŭṁbaḷŭ` - Pronounced `ŭmbaḷŭ`.
- `ŭ + m̐ + du` - As in other Dravidian languages, `du` is the neuter gender singular suffix in Tulu too.
    - `=> ŭṁdu` - The nasalisation turns into anusvāra which is pronounced here as `n` due to the `d` that follows, `ŭndu`.
- `=> ŭ + m̐ + erŭ` - `erŭ` seems to be the root rational singular suffix in Tulu.
    - `=> ŭṁ + erŭ` - The nasalisation turns into anusvāra which is pronounced here as `m`.
        - `=> ŭmerŭ` - The anusvāra is pronounced here as `m`.
            - `=> ŭṁberŭ` - Pronounced `ŭmberŭ`.
- `ŭ + m̐ + kŭḷŭ` - `kŭḷŭ` (like `gaḷu` in Kannada) seems to be a plural suffix in Tulu.
    - `=> ŭṁ + kŭḷŭ` - The nasalisation turns into anusvāra which is pronounced here as `m`.
        - `=> ŭṁkŭḷŭ` - The anusvāra is pronounced here as `m`, `ŭmkŭḷŭ`.
            - `=> ŭṁbŭkŭḷŭ => ŭṁbakŭḷŭ` - The anusvāra is pronounced here as `m`, `=> ŭmbŭkŭḷŭ => ŭmbakŭḷŭ`.

In IPA,
- `ɯ + ̃ + e` - `e` seems to be the root masculine singular suffix in Tulu.
    - `=> ɯm + je` - The nasalisation turns into anusvāra which is pronounced here as `m`
    and an euphonic `j` has infixed before `e`.
        - `=> ɯmje` - The anusvāra is pronounced here as `m`.
            - `=> ɯmbje` - The anusvāra is pronounced here as `m`.
- `ɯ + ̃ + əɭɯ` - As in other Dravidian languages, `əɭɯ` is a feminine singular suffix in Tulu too.
    - `=> ɯm + əɭɯ` - The nasalisation turns into anusvāra which is pronounced here as `m`.
        - `=> ɯməɭɯ` - The anusvāra is pronounced here as `m`.
            - `=> ɯmbəɭɯ` - The anusvāra is pronounced here as `m`.
- `ɯ + ̃ + d̪u` - As in other Dravidian languages, `d̪u` is the neuter gender singular suffix in Tulu too.
    - `=> ɯn̪d̪u` - The nasalisation turns into anusvāra which is pronounced here as `n̪` due to the `d̪` that follows.
- `=> ɯ + ̃ + eɾɯ` - `eɾɯ` seems to be the root rational singular suffix in Tulu.
    - `=> ɯm + eɾɯ` - The nasalisation turns into anusvāra which is pronounced here as `m`.
        - `=> ɯmeɾɯ` - The anusvāra is pronounced here as `m`.
            - `=> ɯmbeɾɯ` - The anusvāra is pronounced here as `m`.
- `ɯ + ̃ + kɯɭɯ` - `kɯɭɯ` (like `gəɭu` in Kannada) seems to be a plural suffix in Tulu.
    - `=> ɯm + kɯɭɯ` - The nasalisation turns into anusvāra which is pronounced here as `m`.
        - `=> ɯmkɯɭɯ` - The anusvāra is pronounced here as `m`.
            - `=> ɯmbɯkɯɭɯ => ɯmbakɯɭɯ` - The anusvāra is pronounced here as `m`.

The appearance of an euphonic `b` as an infix after the anusvāra which is pronounced as `m` is similar to linguistic processes
in other languages too where an euphonic consonant comes as in fix after a nasal consonant.
For example, the  name `Henry` has an alternate for `Hendry`; similarly, `Thomson` has the alternate form `Thompson`.
So, *it would not be wrong to say that `ŭṁbye`, `ŭṁbaḷŭ`, `ŭṁberŭ` etc. are derived from `ŭmye`, `ŭmaḷŭ`,  `ŭmerŭ` etc., respectively*.
Furthermore, the alternate forms of these pronouns which start with `i` instead of `ŭ` (`iṁbye`, `iṁbaḷŭ` etc.) must have been derived
by the `ŭ` turning into `i`
and the alternate forms which start with the consonant `m` instead of a vowel (`mekḷŭ`, `mokḷŭ`, `merŭ`, `mōḷŭ` etc.) must have been derived
from the forms without the euphonic `b` infix (`ŭmkŭḷŭ`, `ŭmerŭ` etc.) by losing the initial `ŭ`.

From this discussion, *it becomes clear that nasalisation is indeed hidden inside the third-person demonstrative pronouns of Dravidian languages*.
Also, the close relation between the euphonic infixes `v`, found in `ivanu`, `ivaḷu`, `ivaru` of Kannada
and `b` preceded by the nasal anusvāra/`m` , found in `ŭṁbye`, `ŭṁbaḷŭ`, `ŭṁberŭ` of Tulu is notable. 
Clearly, the euphonic `v`, anusvāra/`m`, `b` are derived from the original nasalisation.
The similarity in pronunciation of `v`, `m` and `b` is also noteworthy.

In most of the other Dravidian languages, `i` and `u` are used as the proximal and medial demonstrative pronominal roots, respectively.
But in Tulu, `ŭ` is used as the proximal demonstrative pronominal root
and the medial demonstrative pronominal forms do not exist (at least in the modern dialects).

Let's now investigate the reasons behind this peculiarity [next](#origins-of-the-form-and-semantics-of-the-the-root-vowel-u).

#### Dative Presentative ŭṁda of Tulu

Tulu has a [dative presentative](https://ygdp.yale.edu/phenomena/dative-presentatives) `ŭṁda`,
where the anusvāra is pronounced as `n` due the `d` that follows (`ŭnda`).
Here `ŭ` is used in both the proximal demonstrative as well the *presentative* senses.
Kannada has the equivalent `ikō`/`igō` which are clearly derived from the proximal demonstrative `i`. 
Also, the anusvāra/`n` here is clearly derived from the original nasalisation.

#### Origins of the form and semantics of the the root vowel u

Tulu using `ŭ` in the the proximal demonstrative pronouns and the dative presentative form `ŭṁda` (the Kannada equivalent being `ikō`/`igō`),
suggests that the original form and semantics of the root vowel `u` might be subtler than the commonly accepted medial demonstrative sense.

Regarding the origins of the form, a possibility is that `u` might be originally derived from `ŭ`.
This is supported by the fact that Kannada and Telugu use `u` wherever Tulu uses `ŭ`
and that wherever it doesn't affect semantics, alternate forms for the words with `ŭ` can be seen even in Tulu where `ŭ` turns into `u`.
But it is difficult to conclude that `u` is derived from `ŭ` without further supporting arguments and evidence.

The medial demonstrative pronominal forms with the root `u` are quite rare in most Dravidian languages (especially so in the modern spoken dialects).
They are almost non-existant as independent pronominal forms in Modern Kannada.
But the root is still found in fragments and suffixes.
For example,

- `naḍe + udu => naḍevudu`
- `naḍe + u => naḍeyu`
    - `naḍeyu + udu => naḍeyuvudu`
- `tiḷi + udu => tiḷivudu`
- `tiḷi + u + udu => tiḷiyuvudu`
- `ā + da + udu => ādudu`
- `ā + udu => āvudu`
- `yā + udu => yāvudu`
- `ā + uvu => āvuvu`
- `yā + uvu => yāvuvu`

The `u` found in these forms turn into `a` in the northern dialects of Kannada.
For example, [aṁbikātanayadatta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._R._Bendre) in his famous poem "[hr̥daya samudra](https://jnaanasootaka.blogspot.com/2022/01/blog-post_26.html)" says *miṁcubaḷaga tereteregaḷāgi `aleyuvadu` puṭṭapūrā*.
Havyaka Kannada also shows the same process of `u` turning into `a`.
For example, `naḍevadu`, `tiḷivadu` etc.

Words ending in a consonant being suffixed with a euphonic `u` (`kaṇ => kaṇṇu`, `kāl => kālu`) is a well known phenomenon in Modern Kannada.
This is also very common in Telugu.
Spoken dialects of Tulu, Tamil and Malayalam usually pronounce the consonant ending with a suffixed vowel `ŭ` (`kaṇ => kaṇṇu`, `kāl => kālu` etc.).
Also, in Modern Kannada, when such words where the original `ŭ` has turned into `u` are suffixed with anything starting with a vowel, the trailing `u` of the preceding word usually disappears following the process of [lōpasaṁdhi](https://kn.wikipedia.org/wiki/ಲೋಪಸಂಧಿ) (`kaṇṇu + iḍu => kaṇṇiḍu` etc.).

It is also common for `u` to disappear in the spoken dialects of Modern Kannada even in the middle of words.
For example, `ādudariṁda => āddariṁda`.

It is tempting to speculate that `u` being originally derived from `ŭ` might be the reason behind `u` sometimes dropping off or being replaced by `a`,
because the pronunciation of `ŭ` seems fit to turning into `a`, `u` and disappearing.
But it is hard to conclude based only these speculations without further supporting arguments and evidence.
So, I leave the discussion on the origins of the form of the demonstrative root vowel `u` here, incomplete.

However, the above examples and discussion shed more light on the semantics of the demonstrative root vowel `u` too.
As already mentioned above, most scholars have considered the vowel `u` to be the medial demonstrative pronominal root and rightly so.
But *that may not be its only semantics*.
*It seems appropriate to suppose that, in addition to the medial demonstrative semantics, it also has [presentative](https://ygdp.yale.edu/phenomena/dative-presentatives) semantics.*
*Presentative* as in `here you go` or how a lawyer might present evidence saying `Exhibit A`;
but here, I propose here that Dravidian languages use the root vowel `u` in the presentative sense much more systematically
(as they do the other pronominal roots) than in English.
As seen [above](#dative-presentative-ŭṁda-of-tulu), the semantics of the Tulu `ŭṁda` is clearly presentative.
Even in Kannada, the suffix `udu` in `māḍuvudu`, `baredudu` etc. adds the semantics of presence or relevance to the
action indicated by the verb root; to say it adds the semantics of medial distance to the action makes no sense.
*Since the presentative semantics has clear overtones of both metaphorical and physical medial (and proximal) distance,
it seems appropriate to even say that the medial demonstrative semantics of `u` is derived from the original presentative semantics.*

Considering that the presentative semantics also indicates logical and/or physical proximity too,
it seems appropriate that Tulu uses `ŭ` as he proximal demonstrative pronominal root.
In Kannada, masters of ceremony use the proximal demonstrative rational plural `ivaru` to introduce / presenting important guests to the audience.
This also indicates a close relationship between not only the root vowels `i` and `u` but also the proximal, medial demonstrative and presentative
semantics.
Because the presentative pronominal forms derived from `u` have now disappeared from use in Modern Kannada,
the semantically related proximal demonstrative pronominal form `ivaru` seems to have been pressed into service in their stead.
If the presentative pronouns derived from `u` were still in use in Kannada, it might have been more appropriate use `uvaru` on such occasions.
If it is unavoidable to lose one of the distal `u`, the proximal `i` and the presentative `u`, it might be more logical to lose the proximal `i` like in Tulu
than to lose the presentative `u` like in Kannada. 
But languages do not evolve based on logical analyses, of course.
But that languages largely show logical consistency is undeniable.
But it is lucky that these three root vowels (`a`, `i` and `u`) have been used such simple, logical and beautiful regularity
in the [Proto-Dravidian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Dravidian_language) language.
The fact that this simple and logical regularity has survived to a great extent (though partially) even in the modern Dravidian languages,
leaves significant clues that aid linguists in the search of pronominal roots.

The fact that the presentative semantics of `u` metaphorically and/or physically indicates not only a medial (`u`) distance but also proximity (`i`),
will come in handy in the investigation of the second-person pronominal roots later.

#### Neuter gender singular suffixes of finite verb forms in Havyaka Kannada

As seen above, the third-person distal demonstrative neuter gender singular `adu` must have been derived from the original `atu`/`attu`.
The neuter gender singular suffixes of finite verb forms in Havyaka Kannada seem to support this argument further.
For example,

- `hō + attu => hōdattu (with d infix)` - In Kannada, `hōyitu`
- `tin + attu => tiṁdattu (with d infix)` - In Kannada, `tiṁditu`

Similarly, that Old Kannada must have had the original forms `utu`/`uttu` from which the third-person medial demonstrative neuter gender singular `udu`
must have derived, is also clear from the neuter gender suffixes of finite verb forms in Havyaka Kannada.
For example,

- `hō + uttu => hōvuttu (with v infix)` - In Kannada, `hōguvudu`
- `hēḷ + uttu => hēḷuttu` - In Kannada, `hēḷuvudu`

#### Neuter gender singular suffixes of finte verb forms in Kannada

As already seen [above](#origins-of-the-form-and-semantics-of-the-the-root-vowel-u), though the third-person presentative/medial demonstrative
neuter gender singular pronoun `udu` of Old Kannada might have disappeared in Modern Kannada, has survived as a neuter gender singular suffix
of finite verb forms.
Similarly, the apparently third-person proximal demonstrative neuter gender singular `itu` found in `anitu`/`initu`/`enitu`,
can be seen as a neuter gender singular suffix of finite verb forms.
For example,

- `hō + itu => hōyitu (with the euphonic `y` infix)`
- `tin + itu => tiṁditu (with `d` infix)`
- `hēḷ + itu => hēḷitu`

But even in Old Kannada and also in many regional dialects, there alternate forms without the vowel `i`.
For example, `hōtu`, `tintu`, `hēḷtu`, etc.

So, proximal `i` or presentative/medial `u` might sometimes appear at the beginning of neuter gender suffixes of finite verb forms.

#### The relationship between the anta of Tamil and anta, atta and antu of Kannada

As already mentioned [above](#neuter-gender-forms), the neuter gender singular suffix `du` must have been originally derived from `tu`.
It was also [seen](#the-euphonic-infix-v-in-the-masculine-and-feminine-singular-and-rational-plural-forms) that nasalisation mediates
whenever a suffix is appended to pronominal roots and leads to many different forms based on a set of related processes.
Of these forms, `atu`, `aṁtu`, `attu`, `adu`, `aṁdu` are significant.
I.e.,

In ISO 15919,
- `a + m̐ + tu => am̐tu`
    - `=> atu` - The nasalisation disappears.
    - `=> aṁtu` - The nasalisation turns into anusvāra which is pronounced here as `n` due to the `t` that follows, `antu`.
        - `=> attu` - The anusvāra turns into a gemination of the following consonant `t`.
    - `=> am̐du` - `t` turns into `d`.
        - `=> adu` - The nasalisation disappears.
        - `=> aṁdu` - The nasalisation turns into anusvāra which is pronounced as `n` due to the `d` that follows, `andu`.

In IPA,
- `ə + ̃ + t̪u => ə̃t̪u`
    - `=> ət̪u` - The nasalisation disappear.
    - `=> ən̪t̪u` - The nasalisation turns into anusvāra which is pronounced here as `n̪` due to the `t̪` that follows.
        - `=> ət̪t̪u` - The anusvāra turns into a gemination of the following consonant `t̪`.
    - `=> ə̃d̪u` - `t̪` turns into `d̪`.
        - `=> əd̪u` - The nasalisation disappears.
        - `=> ən̪d̪u` - The nasalisation turns into anusvāra which is pronounced as `n̪` due to the `d̪` that follows.

Of these forms, `atu`, `attu`, `adu` have the same semantics in Old Kannada as `adu` in Modern Kannada.
But [`aṁtu`](https://kn.wiktionary.org/wiki/ಅಂತು) and [`aṁdu`](https://kn.wiktionary.org/wiki/ಅಂದು) have different semantics.
The same set of processes derive the proximal demonstrative forms `itu`, `iṁtu`, `ittu`, `idu`, `iṁdu`
and the interrogative forms `etu`, `eṁtu`, `ettu`, `edu`, `eṁdu` as well.
Of these forms too, [`iṁtu`](https://kn.wiktionary.org/wiki/ಇಂತು), [`iṁdu`](https://kn.wiktionary.org/wiki/ಇಂದು), [`eṁtu`](https://kn.wiktionary.org/wiki/ಎಂತು), [`eṁdu`](https://kn.wiktionary.org/wiki/ಎಂದು) have semantics different from their related standard pronominal forms.
Some forms (for example, `edu`) is in use only in some regional dialects,
while others (for example, `etu`, `ettu`) are not at all found amongst the pronominal forms in Kannada.

Some closely related forms to the above mentioned pronominal forms also notable here.
For example, `aṁta`, [`atta`](https://kn.wiktionary.org/wiki/ಅತ್ತ), `anitu`.
Their corresponding proximal `iṁta`, [`itta`](https://kn.wiktionary.org/wiki/ಇತ್ತ_ಕಡೆಗೆ), `initu`
and interrogative `eṁta`, [`etta`](ttps://kn.wiktionary.org/wiki/ಎತ್ತ), `enitu` also exist.
Of these too, some forms (for example, `eṁta`) are in use only in some regional dialects.

For the sake of argument, let us keep the semantic differences aside and analyse only the similarities in processes of derivation.
The similarities in the processes of derivation of
`atu`/`itu`/`etu`, `aṁtu`/`iṁtu`/`eṁtu`, `attu`/`ittu`/`ettu`, `adu`/`idu`/`edu`, `aṁdu`/`iṁdu`/`eṁdu` are already shown above
and the processe that derive the forms `aṁta`/`iṁta`/`eṁta`, `atta`/`itta`/`etta`, `anitu`/`initu`/`enitu` are not difficult to see.
I.e.,

- `aṁtu + a => aṁta`
- `ittu + a => itta`

The derivation of `anitu`/`initu`/`enitu` becomes clear by the set of processes explained in "[anusvārada anusāra](../ಅನುಸ್ವಾರದ%20ಅನುಸಾರ.md)".
I.e., nasalisation mediates when the root vowels, distal `a`, proximal `i`, interrogative `e`, are suffixed with the proximal demonstrative neuter gender singular pronoun `itu` and the nasalisation then turns into `n`, resulting in `anitu`/`initu`/`enitu`.
I.e.,

In ISO 15919,
- `e + m̐ + itu => enitu` - The nasalisation turns into `n`.

In IPA,
- `e + ̃ + ɪt̪u => en̪ɪt̪u` - The nasalisation turns into `n̪`.

The [Kannada dictionary](https://archive.org/download/BVPKSPKANNADANIGHANTUSAMPOORNA) published by
the [Kannada Sahitya Parishat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada_Sahitya_Parishat)
gives the alternative forms `anittu`/`inittu`/`enittu` for `anitu`/`initu`/`enitu`.
This suggests that `itu`/`ittu` alternate forms also existed in Old Kannada
similar to the `atu`/`attu` alternate forms as can be seen in `ninatu`/`enatu`/`tanatu` and `ninattu`/`enattu`/`tanattu` as already mentioned [above](#neuter-gender-forms).
So, the existance of the forms and the processes of derivations of `atu`/`attu` and `itu`/`ittu` cannot be mere speculation.
The same dictionary gives the forms `anibar`/`inibar`/`enibar` as the rational plural counterparts of `anitu`/`initu`/`enitu`.
This confirms that `atu`/`itu`, `attu`/`ittu` forms had the neuter gender singular semantics in Old Kannada,
because it is easy to see that the `anibar`/`inibar`/`enibar` forms are produced by suffixing the proximal demonstrative rational plural pronoun `ivar`
to the root vowels, the distal `a`, the proximal `i` and the interrogative `e`.
are suffixed with 
I.e.,

In ISO 15919,
- `a/i/e + m̐ + ivar => anivar/inivar/enivar` - The nasalisation turns into `n`.
    - `=> anibar/inibar/enibar` - `v` turning into `b` is a common process in Kannada.

In IPA,
- `ə/ɪ/e + ̃ + ɪʋəɾ => ən̪ɪʋəɾ/ɪn̪ɪʋəɾ/en̪ɪʋəɾ` - The nasalisation turns into `n`.
    - `=> ən̪ɪbəɾ/ɪn̪ɪbəɾ/en̪ɪbəɾ` - `ʋ` turning into `b` is a common process in Kannada.

So, *this confirms not only that `anitu`/`initu`/`enitu` contain the suffix `itu`,
but also that `tu` is the original neuter gender singular suffix from which `du` is derived,
because, while `t` turning into `d` is a natural process in Kannada, `d` turning into `t` is not so common*.

Having analysed the similarities in the process of derivation of these related pronominal forms in isolation,
let us now consider the differences in their semantics.

As seen above, though not used as independent pronouns, `atu`/`attu`, `itu`/`ittu` were used in Old Kannada as suffixes
in the third-person demonstrative neuter gender singular pronominal semantics as seen in `ninatu`/ `ninattu`, `anitu`/`anittu` etc.
But `aṁtu`/`iṁtu`/`eṁtu`, `aṁta`/`iṁta`/`eṁta`, `atta`/`itta`/`etta`, `anitu`/`initu`/`enitu` have slightly different,
though still closely related to the neuter gender singular, semantics.
So, it is natural to question if it is possible to decide on the roots and processes of derivation of these forms
based only on the similiarities in the pronominal root and  processes of derivation.

These forms (or forms close to these) are found in other Dravidian languages.
But in some cases their semantics is close to and in other cases very different from in Kannada.

Please note that I am not very familiar with the transliteration of Tamil and Malayalam in ISO 15919.
So, I might have made mistakes in the transliteration of Tamil and Malayalam here and elsewhere in this document.
I would be grateful if knowledgeable readers point out the mistake and help improve the document.

For example, in Tamil,

- [`aṁdu`](https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/burrow_query.py?page=1) - (written `antu`), `in that way`

In the different Dravidian languages, these words seem to have been produced from similar roots and by similar processes of derivation.
Also, not only are the semantic differences are also obvious, there also seems to be difference in the semantic differences.
I.e., there is not commonality even in the semantic difference.
In other words, from language to language the ways by which semantics change also seem to different.
So, it doesn't seem appropriate to suppose that these words acquired different semantics because they were produced from
different roots following different processes of derivation.
Because if it was so, there wouldn't have been so much similarity in the word forms.
Instead, it seems more appropriate to suppose that these words were produced from the same Proto-Dravidian roots,
undergoing the same set of processes of derivation, leading to the original third-person neuter gender singular semantics,
which later in due course of time in the various branches of the language family, came to acquire different semantics,
though still closely related to the original third-person neuter gender singular semantics.

The way the semantics of these words changed in Kannada can be supposed as follows.

- `aṁdu` - The original distal (in the sense of space) demonstrative neuter gender singular pronoun (equivalent of `adu`) becomes distal in the sense of time,
leading to the current Kannada semantics of `that day`, `that time`.
If this is one possibility, another is that Kannada `aṁdu`, Tamil `aṁṟu` and Malayalam `annu` all derive from a common ancestral form.

- `iṁdu` - The original proximal (in the sense of space) demonstrative neuter gender singular pronoun (equivalent of `idu`)
becomes proximal in the sense of time, leading to the current Kannada semantics of `this day`, `this time`.
If this is one possibility, another is that Kannada `iṁdu`, Tamil `iṁṟu` and Malayalam `innu` all derive from a common ancestral form.

- `eṁdu` - Though `edu` now survives in the interrogative neuter gender sense (`what`) only in some regional dialects of Kannada,
there are reasons suppose that `edu` might be the original interrogative neuter gender pronominal form from which `yāvudu` is derived.
More details about this can be seen [here]().
So, the original interrogative (in the sense of space) neuter gender singular pronoun (equivalent of `edu`) becomes interrogative in the sense of time,
leading to the current Kannada semantics of `which day`, `which/what time`, `when`.
If this is one possibility, another is that Kannada `eṁdu`, Tamil `eṁṟu` and Malayalam `ennu`all derive from a common ancestral form.

- `aṁtu` - The original distal (in the sense of space) demonstrative neuter gender singular pronoun (equivalent of `atu`) becomes distal
in the sense of way or procedure, leading to the current Kannada semantics of `in that way`.

- `iṁtu` - The original proximal (in the sense of space) demonstrative neuter gender singular pronoun (equivalent of `itu`) becomes proximal
in the sense of way or procedure, leading to the current Kannada semantics of `in this way`, `thus`.

- `eṁtu` - The original interrogative (in the sense of space) neuter gender singular pronoun (equivalent of `etu`/`edu`) becomes interrogative
in the sense of way or procedure, leading to the current Kannada semantics of `how`, `in which way`.

- `atta` - When the original distal (in the sense of space) demonstrative pronominal form `attu` (equivalent of `atu`/`adu`) is suffixed with `a`
(which, among other things, has genitive semantics), (i.e., `attu + a => atta`), it naturally acquires a distal directional semantics,
leading to the current Kannada semantics of `on/to that side`, `in that direction`.

- `itta` - When the original proximal (in the sense of space) demonstrative pronominal form `ittu` (equivalent of `itu`/`idu`) is suffixed with `a`
(which, among other things, has genitive semantics), (i.e., `ittu + a => itta`), it naturally acquires a proximal directional semantics,
leading to the current Kannada semantics of `on/to this side`, `in this direction`.

- `etta` - When the original interrogative (in the sense of space) pronominal form `ettu` (equivalent of `edu`) is suffixed with `a`
(which, among other things, has genitive semantics), (i.e., `ettu + a => etta`), it naturally acquires an interrogative directional semantics,
leading to the current Kannada semantics of `on/to which side`, `in which direction`.

- `aṁta` - When the original distal (in the sense of space) demonstrative pronominal form `aṁtu` (equivalent of `atu`/`adu`) is suffixed with `a`
(which, among other things, has genitive semantics), (i.e., `aṁtu + a => anta`), it naturally acquires a distal directional semantics,
which includes the semantics of a distal demonstrative determiner like the much more widely used `ā`.
This argument is supported by the fact that the related `aṁda` of Tamil (written as `aṁta`) is indeed used as a distal demonstrative determiner.
But `aṁta` is rarely used in the distal demonstrative determiner in Kannada.
Perhaps it can be found as a suffix in the words like `hāgaṁta`, `ēnaṁta`, though, it is possible that has a different derivation and semantics.

- `iṁta`/`iṁda` - When the original proximal (in the sense of space) demonstrative pronominal forms `iṁtu`/`iṁdu` (equivalents of `itu`/`idu`)
is suffixed with `a` (which, among other things, has genitive semantics), (i.e., `iṁtu/iṁdu + a => iṁta/iṁda`),
they naturally acquire a proximal directional semantics, which includes the semantics of a proximal demonstrative determiner
like the much more widely used `ī`.
This argument is supported by the fact that the related `iṁda` of Tamil (written as `iṁta`) is indeed used as a proximal demonstrative determiner.
But `iṁta`/`iṁda` also are rarely used in the proximal demonstrative determiner in Kannada.
But `iṁta` can still be seen as a suffix in forms like `bānigiṁta`, `beṭṭakkiṁta` etc. where it signifies
a direction physically or metaphorically different from the semantics of the preceding word fragment.
Likewise, `iṁda` can be seen as a suffix in the ostensibly instrumental forms like `bāniṁda`, `maradiṁda` etc.
More detailed discussion of these suffixes can be seen [here]().

- `eṁta` - When the original interrogative (in the sense of space) pronominal form `eṁtu` (equivalent of `edu`) is suffixed with `a`,
(which, among other things, has genitive semantics), (i.e., `eṁtu + a => eṁta`), in naturally acquires an interrogative directional semantics,
which includes the semantics of an interrogative determiner like `yāva` or `which`.
Specific (for example, `which`) and general (for eample, `what`) interrogative determiner forms are closely related in many languages.
For example, in English, `Which delicacy is this?` vs. `What delicay is this?`.
In Kannada, `yāva tiṁḍiyidu?`, `ēnu tiṁḍiyidu?`.
So, it is not surprising that `eṁta` is used in some dialects of Kannada (like Havyaka Kannada, [Mangaluru Kannada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangalore_Kannada) etc.) in both the specific (`which`) and general (`what`) sense.
For example, `nīnu eṁta (eṁta = ēnu) hēḷiddu?` (`what did you say?`), `adu eṁta (eṁta = yāva) mara?` (`which/what kind of tree is that?`).

- `anitu`/`initu`/`enitu`, `anibar`/`inibar`/`enibar` - When the original root vowels, the distal `a`, the proximal `i` and the interrogative `e`,
are suffixed with the proximal demonstrative pronouns, the neuter gender singular `itu` and the rational plural `ivar`,
the forms `anitu`/`initu`/`enitu` and `anibar`/`inibar`/`enibar` are produced.
Here, it seems that, the proximal demonstrative pronouns `itu` and `ivar` seem to have been used in the sense of quantity, leading to the semantics of
`this/that/how much/many`.

Thus, when variant forms are produced by a related set of processes acting on the same roots and suffixes,
the variant forms naturally develop variations semantics too over time and in time, if the original language diverges into dialects
and languages, different branches of the divergence are likely to diverge in the variations of the semantics too, which
is what is seen in these set of related words.
So, just because words have different semantics in the modern dialects of languages,
it is not necessary to conclude that they must have been produced by different roots, suffixes and processes.

#### Semantics of and the processes behind aṁta/iṁta/eṁta

Of the pronominal forms discussed above, it is a commonly held view that `aṁta`/`iṁta`/`eṁta` have formed
from `aṁtaha`/`iṁtaha`/`eṁtaha` by losing the trailing `ha`.
Alternatively, it is also said that `aṁta`/`iṁta`/`eṁta` have formed from `aṁtha`/`iṁtha`/`eṁtha`
(having the same semantics as `aṁtaha`/`iṁtaha`/`eṁtaha`), by the [aspirated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirated_consonant) `th` turning into `t`.
For example, the [Kannada Wiktionary](https://kn.wiktionary.org/wiki/ಮುಖ್ಯ_ಪುಟ) seems to consider [`iṁta`](https://kn.wiktionary.org/wiki/ಇಂತ)
as an alternate form of [`iṁtha`](https://kn.wiktionary.org/wiki/ಇಂಥ).
But native Kannada (Dravidian, in fact) words do not have mahāprāṇas/aspirated consonants
and it is well known in linguistics that pronominal forms are usually native to the languages and rarely borrowed.
So, it is clear that `aṁtha`/`iṁtha`/`eṁtha` have formed from `aṁtaha`/`iṁtaha`/`eṁtaha` by fusing of the traliing `ta` and `ha`
into the aspirated form `tha`.
This means that `aṁta`/`iṁta`/`eṁta` cannot have been derived from `aṁtha`/`iṁtha`/`eṁtha`.
And it is not completely correct to say that `aṁta`/`iṁta`/`eṁta` have formed from `aṁtaha`/`iṁtaha`/`eṁtaha` either,
because `eṁta`, which is widely used in the western dialects (Mangaluru and Havyaka Kannada etc.),
clearly has semantics different from `eṁtaha` in those dialects.

`aṁtaha`/`iṁtaha`/`eṁtaha` of the Middle and Modern Kannada have derived by suffixing `aṁtu`/`iṁtu`/`eṁtu` with `aha`,
which itself is derived from the `appa` of Old Kannada.
I.e.

- `aṁtu/iṁtu/eṁtu + appa => aṁtappa/iṁtappa/eṁtappa => aṁtaha/iṁtaha/eṁtaha`

Naturally, semantics of these forms are something like `that kind of/this kind of/what kind of`.
While these forms are indeed used in many dialects with these semantics, they almost never used with these semantics
in the western dialects of Kannada (Mangaluru, Havyaka Kannada etc.).
For example,

- `īga eṁta māḍudu?` - meaning, `what to do now?`
- `eṁta hēḷtā iddi?` - meaning, `what are you saying?`
- `niṁge illi eṁta kelasa?` - meaning, `what work/business do you have here?`
- `adu eṁta mara?` - meaning, `what/which tree is that?`. It might seem the semantics of `what kind of` is also appropriate here,
but seeing the above examples and the close relationship between the specific and general interrogative determiners,
the semantics of `what`/`which` seems to be more appropriate here.
- `nīnu eṁtakke illi baṁdaddu?` - meaning, `why did you come here?`. It is notable that Tamil also uses the equivalent form `ennŭkkŭ`
with the same semantics.

From these example, it seems more appropriate to say that `eṁta` as used in the western dialects (Mangaluru, Havyaka Kannada etc.),
is derived when the interrogative neuter gender singular pronominal form `eṁtu` (equivalent of `etu`/`edu`) is suffixed with `a`,
which, among other things, has genitive semantics, rather than to say that it is derived from `aṁtaha`/`iṁtaha`/`eṁtaha`.
If there were no possbile set of processes to derive `aṁta`/`iṁta`/`eṁta` from anything other than `aṁtaha`/`iṁtaha`/`eṁtaha`,
we might have had to be content conclude that that is indeed the derivation and the change in semantics in the western dialects
might have happened over a period of divergence.
Now that process of producing `aṁta`/`iṁta`/`eṁta` by suffixing `a` to `aṁtu`/`iṁtu`/`eṁtu` is clear, as already shown [above](#the-relationship-between-the-anta-of-tamil-and-anta-atta-and-antu-of-kannada),
it is appropriate to say that `eṁta` is also derived from `eṁtu` and hence has the interrogative neuter gender singular pronominal semantics too.

Given this set of arguments, it seems unfortunate that the Kannada Dictionary of Karnataka Sahitya Parishat gives only the
`aṁtappa/iṁtappa => aṁta/iṁta` derivation and does not even have an independent entry for `eṁta`.

#### Are the third-person demonstrative pronominal roots nasalised?

In all the processes described above, nasalisation mediates the appending of suffixes to the pronominal roots.
Alternatively, the same phenomenon could be stated as the pronominal roots are originally nasalised themselves.
There doesn't seem to be much qualitative difference between these two descriptions of the same underlying phenomenon.
Both the descriptions lead to the same set of processes and pronominal forms.

#### Third-person demonstrative pronouns in Kannada and their relationship to case suffixes

As already argued [above](#the-relationship-between-the-anta-of-tamil-and-anta-atta-and-antu-of-kannada), the forms like `iṁta`, `iṁda`
are derived from the original proximal (in the sense of space) demonstrative neuter gender singular pronominal forms `iṁtu`/`iṁdu`(`itu`/`idu`),
by suffixing `a`, which, among other things, has genitive semantics, i.e., `iṁtu/iṁdu + a => iṁta/iṁda`.
But they are not used as independent pronouns and only used as suffixes in `bānigiṁta`, `bāniṁda` etc.
to indicate a different physical or metaphorical direction from the semantics of the preceding word fragment.
In [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit), a single [ablative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablative_case) form `ākāśāt`
has the semantics of both the example words `bānigiṁta` and `bāniṁda`.

*[Sediyapu Krishna Bhat](https://kn.wikipedia.org/wiki/ಸೇಡಿಯಾಪು_ಕೃಷ್ಣಭಟ್ಟ), in his pathbreaking research article "*paṁcamī vibhakti*"
(this article has been included by [Dr. Padekallu Vishnu Bhat](https://www.clubhouse.com/@padekallu?utm_medium=ch_profile&utm_campaign=wSPhDP4r4o-9Pe_zqseDBA-212445)
in the book "*vicāraprapaṁca*" which is a collection of writings of Sediyapu Krishna Bhat),
has argued against the modern scholarly consensus that Kannada doesn't have an ablative suffix and for ablative semantics too it use the
[instrumental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_case) suffix.
He goes on to argue that the ostensibly instrumental suffixes in Kannada (`iṁ`, `iṁda` etc.) are really ablative suffixes
and for the instrumental case, Kannada relies mostly on the [locative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locative_case) suffix
(for example, `kattiyalli kaḍi` etc.).*
In support of this, he argues that some kind of *separation* is key to the ablative case.
I.e., in `maradiṁda haṇṇu bittu`, `maradiṁda` is the ablative form because of the separation of the fruit from the tree.
Similarly, in `kattiyalli kaḍi`, `kattiyalli` is the instrumental form because `katti` is instrumental in the action `kaḍi`,
though `alli` is generally considered to be the locative suffix.
Also, in the [passive voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_voice) (which is unnatural and rare in Kannada) construction
`rāmaniṁda ahalyeya śāpavimōcaneyāyitu`, `rāmaniṁda` is the instrumental form because `rāma` is instrumental in the lifting of `ahalya`'s curse.
So, `iṁda` is indeed used as an instrumental suffix in Kannada in the passive voice constructions.
But given that passive voice is unnatural and rate in Kannada, Sediyapu Krishna Bhat's thesis that the sufixes `iṁ`, `iṁda` etc. are
really ablative suffixes in Kannada seems sound overall.

It is notable that `iṁta` suffix is only ever used in the ablative sense and never in the instrumental sense.

As already seen above, `iṁta`, `iṁda` are derived from the original proximal (in the sense of space) demonstrative neuter gender singular pronominal forms
`iṁtu`/`iṁdu`(`itu`/`idu`), by suffixing `a`, which, among other things, has genitive semantics, giving them a kind of proximal directional semantics.
When such a proximal demonstrative/directional suffix is appended to any word fragment,
it suggests a physical or metaphorical proximal direction from the semantics of the preceding word fragment and hence, separation;
thus, achieving ablative semantics.
So, it is natural that they are used as ablative suffixes in Kannada.

Taken together, this validates Sediyapu Krishna Bhat's argument that `iṁ`, `iṁda` etc. are ablative suffixes in Kannada,
not only from the perspective of semantics and usage, but also from the Proto-Dravidian third-person proximal demonstrative pronominal root
and the linguistic and grammatical processes that act on it.
*This inexorably leads to the conclusion that the ablative/instrumental suffix `iṁ` in Kannada
and the Proto-Dravidian third-person proximal demonstrative pronominal root `im̐`/`ɪ̃` are one and the same.
I.e., Kannada has put the third-person proximal demonstrative pronominal root (`im̐`/`ɪ̃`) to use as the ablative/instrumental suffix too.*

But Old Kannada scholars have insisted that `iṁ`/`iṁda`/`iṁde` are instrumental suffixes and `attaṇiṁ` is the ablative suffix
(for example, śabdamaṇidarpaṇaṁ, verse [103](https://archive.org/details/abdamaidarpaa00kirjuoft/page/134/mode/2up)).
Even some Modern Kannada scholars have argued that `iṁ`/`iṁda`/`iṁde`  are indeed only instrumental suffixes
and `deseyiṁda` is the ablative suffix but an unnatural one, especially, in spoken dialects of Modern Kannada
(for example, , kannaḍa kaipiḍi, pages [413](https://archive.org/details/ZeJJ_kannada-kaipidi-kannada-university-of-mysore/page/413/mode/1up), [೪೧೪](https://archive.org/details/ZeJJ_kannada-kaipidi-kannada-university-of-mysore/page/414/mode/1up) and [406](https://archive.org/details/ZeJJ_kannada-kaipidi-kannada-university-of-mysore/page/406/mode/1up))
As already seen above, `iṁ`/`iṁda`/`iṁde` are not exclusively instrumental suffixes, but in fact, they are more naturally ablative suffixes.
But `deseyiṁda` is indeed unnatural to Kannada and rare outside works on linguistics and grammar.
Certainly, it did not catch on in speech.
It is relevant here to note that though `deseyiṁda` has `dese` in the beginning which gives it the directional semantics,
the ablative semantics is achieved only when it is suffixed with `iṁda`, the ostensibly instrumental suffix.
Without the `iṁda` suffix, only `dese` is not unfit to be used as an ablative suffix.

Now let's investigate the case for `attaṇiṁ` as an ablative suffix in Old Kannada.
It is clear that `attaṇiṁ` is formed from the fragments `attu`, `aṇ` and `iṁ`.
It is well known in Old Kannada grammar that the case declensions of directional words get an `aṇ` infix
(śabdamaṇidarpaṇaṁ, verse [120](https://archive.org/details/abdamaidarpaa00kirjuoft/page/160/mode/2up)).
But I have argued in a previous [research article](../ಅನುಸ್ವಾರದ%20ಅನುಸಾರ.md#ದಿಗ್ವಾಚಕಶಬ್ದಗಳಲ್ಲಿ-ಅಲ್ಲಲ್ಲಿ-ಕಾಣುವ-ಣಕಾರ) (please note that the document is in Kannada and is yet to be translated to English) that the `aṇ` infix is in fact derived from the [accusative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accusative_case)
suffix `aṁ`/`am̐`/`ə̃` mediating the case declension of such directional words (even in cases other than the accusative).
I.e., including the process of derivation of `attu`, the process for deriving `attaṇiṁ` could be as follows.

In ISO 15919,
- `a + m̐ + tu + a + m̐ +  i +  m̐ =>  (a + m̐ + tu) + (a + m̐) + (i +  m̐)`
    - `=> (am̐tu) + am̐ + (im̐)`
        - `=> (aṁtu) + am̐ + iṁ` - The nasalisation turns into anusvāra which is pronounced as `n` because of the `t` that follows.
            - `=> (attu + am̐) + iṁ` - The anusvāra turns into a gemination of the following consonant `t`. 
                - `=> attam̐ + iṁ` - The trailing `u` disappears according to lōpasaṁdhi.
                    - `=> attaṇiṁ` - The nasalisation turned into `ṇ`.

In IPA,
- `ə + ̃ + t̪u + ə + ̃ + ɪ + ̃ => (ə + ̃ + t̪u) + (ə + ̃) + (ɪ + ̃)`
    - `=> (ə̃t̪u) + ə̃ + (ɪ̃)`
        - `=> (ən̪t̪u) + ə̃ + ɪm` - The nasalisation turns into anusvāra which is pronounced as `n̪` because of the `t̪` that follows.
            - `=> (ət̪t̪u + ə̃) + ɪm` - The anusvāra turns into a gemination of the following consonant `t̪`. 
                - `=> ət̪t̪ə̃ + ɪm` - The trailing `u` disappears according to lōpasaṁdhi.
                    - `=> ət̪t̪əɳɪm` - The nasalisation turns into `ɳ`.

So, the Old Kannada grammarians, having decided that `iṁ`/`iṁda` are exclusively instrumental suffixes, seem to have settled on using
the Proto-Dravidian third-person distal demonstrative pronominal form `attu` as the base for the ablative suffix
because it has the appropriate distal directional semantics.
But having realised that this doesn't achive the required ablative semantics fully, they seem to have resorted to appending the very same
`iṁ` suffix (which they had decided was not the ablative suffix) to finally declare that the required ablative semantics is achieved.
The key reason for this futile exercise seems to be the confusion that `iṁ`/`iṁda` suffixes are exclusively instrumental
and do not have the directional semantics required for the ablative case.
As already shown above, `iṁ`/`iṁda` not only have the proximal demonstrative/directional semantics,
but also, when such a proximal demonstrative/directional suffix is appended to any word fragment,
it suggests a physical or metaphorical proximal direction (and hence, separation) from the semantics of the preceding word fragment,
which is all that is required for the ablative case.
So, *even though `iṁ`/`iṁda`, have proximal demonstrative pronominal semantics when seen as independent words,
add ablative semantics when used as suffixes.*
Not noticing this subtlety seems to be at the heart of the confusion that `iṁ`/`iṁda` are not ablative suffixes.
Even if the `attaṇiṁ` form was constructed to escape from the trap caused by this confusion, that construction too ended up having to use
the very same `iṁ`, which was discarded in the first place as not being an ablative suffix, suffixed to `attu`,
a form generated by a related set of processes working on the distal equivalent root of the very same `iṁ` again.
To paraphrase a famous movie dialogue, grammar gods (i.e., [Goddess Saraswati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraswati)),
are not without a sense of irony.

It is lucky that ordinary Kannadigas did not fall into this trap as they been using `iṁ`/`iṁda` as ablative suffixes freely.
The constructions `attaṇiṁ` and `deseyiṁ` never really caught on.
That even the grammarians who declared the motto "*prayōgaśaraṇāḥ vaiyākaraṇāḥ*" stumbled in this way is a reminder to all of us to 
think a hundred times before declaring any usage in language as incorrect or ungrammatical.

Now that it is clear that the third-person proximal demonstrative pronominal root `im̐`/`ɪ̃` is also used in Kannada as the instrumental/ablative suffix,
it is not hard to see that its distal counterpart, the third-person distal demonstrative pronominal root `am̐`/`ə̃`,
is also used in Kannada as the accusative suffix.
This is because the accusative case indicates the target or object of the action indicated by the verb.
For this a directional sense is need to be added to the root word's semantics to indicate the target or object of the action
and the distal demonstrative/directional `am̐`/`ə̃` when added as a suffix is perfectly suited to add that directional semantics.
I.e., adding the distal demonstrative/directional `am̐`/`ə̃`, makes the base word fragment the target or object of the action;
thus, achieving the accusative semantics.
*This supports the argument that the distal demonstrative pronominal root `am̐`/`ə̃` is also used in Kannada as the accusative suffix,
not just by comparison with the proximal counterpart `im̐`/`ɪ̃` being used in Kannada as the instrumental/ablative suffix,
but also by the processes of derivation and their implication on semantics.*

#### The medial/presentative `udu` and the collectivising/conjugating suffix `uṁ`

In Old Kannada, `uṁ` is used as a collectivising/conjugating suffix.
This is mentioned in śabdamaṇidarpaṇaṁ, verse [133](https://archive.org/details/abdamaidarpaa00kirjuoft/page/177/mode/1up).

###### Summary

The collectivising/conjugating suffixes `aṁ`/`uṁ` do not apply in the genitive case; in the accusative case they apply before the accusative suffix;
in the other cases they apply after the case suffixes.

In Modern Kannada (perhaps in Middle Kannada too), `uṁ` has turned into `ū`.
For example,
- `rāmanū lakṣmaṇanū sīteyū kāḍige hōdaru.`
- As in typical childern's story title, `siṁhavū iliyū`.

As already discussed [above](#origins-of-the-form-and-semantics-of-the-the-root-vowel-u), original semantics of the
medial demonstrative pronominal root `um̐`/`ũ` is *presentative*.
In light of this, it becomes clear that the collectivising/conjugating suffixes, `uṁ` in Old Kannada and `ū` in Modern Kannada,
are originally derived from the presentative pronominal root `um̐`/`ũ`,
because the role of the collectivising/conjugating suffixes `uṁ`/`ū` is to present more one or more things so that the rest of the sentence
can continue on about them.

The derivation process could be as follows.

In ISO 15919,
- `um̐`
    - `=> uṁ` - The nasalisation turns into anusvāra which is pronounced as `m`
    - `=> ū`- The nasalisation elongates the vowel that was nasalised.
    More on this process can be seen [here]().

In IPA,
- `ũ`
    - `=> um` - The nasalisation turns into anusvāra which is pronounced as `m`
    - `=> uː` The nasalisation elongates the vowel that was nasalised.
    More on this process can be seen [here]().

The presentative semantics of `ū` in `siṁhavū iliyū` is easy to see.
Likewise, in `rāmanū lakṣmaṇanū sīteyū kāḍige hōdaru`, the usage of `ū` in the part `rāmanū lakṣmaṇanū sīteyū` presents `rāma`, `lakṣmaṇa` and `sītā`
so that the `kāḍige hōdaru` can be said only once but still apply to all of them together.
Similarly, in Old Kannada, `naranuṁ naranaṁdananaṁ`, `kāliṁdeyuṁ kaiyiṁdeyuṁ`, `drōṇaṁgaṁ ninagaṁ`, `jādiyattaṇiṁdeyuṁ kēdageyattaṇiṁdeyuṁ`,
`caladoḷamācāradoḷaṁ`, `alliyumilliyumelliyaṁ` etc., `um` presents one or more things for the rest of the sentence.

Though this analysis applies to the accusative case as well, the variation in Old Kannada of the collectivising/conjugating suffix  `um` 
applying before the accusative suffix (`aṁ`/`am̐`/`ə̃`) seems peculiar.
I.e., in the above example from śabdamaṇidarpaṇaṁ, `avarumaṁ aṁtakanormeye`, i.e., `avar + uṁ + aṁ => avarumaṁ`.
But in Modern Kannada (perhaps in Middle Kannada too), the collectivising/conjugating suffix `ū` applies after the accusative suffix
just like in the other casess.
For example, the Modern Kannada "translation" of the above Old Kannada example would be `avarannū aṁtakanommeye`,
i.e., `avar + annu + ū => avarannū`.
The difference the processes in Old Kannada and Modern Kannada in the accusative case can be reconciled as follows.

As already mentioned [above](#third-person-demonstrative-pronouns-in-kannada-and-their-relationship-to-case-suffixes),
the accusative case indicates the target or object of the action indicated by the verb.
In a crude comparison to English grammar, it can be said that if the nominative case indicates the
[`subject`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_(grammar) in a sentence, the accusative case indicates the
[`object`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(grammar).
In light of this, both orders of applying of collectivising/conjugating suffix and the accusative suffix can be considered logically sound.

- Modern Kannada, like in other cases, seems to prefer to "objectify" the root word first by appending the accusative suffix `aṁ`/`am̐`/`ə̃`
and then present it for the rest of the sentence by appending the collectivising/conjugating suffix `ū`.

- Old Kannada, in the accusative case, seems to prefer to present the root word first by appending the collectivising/conjugating suffix `um`
and then "objectify" it by appending the accusative suffix `aṁ`/`am̐`/`ə̃`.

Since such "targetting/objectification" semantics is not relevant in the other cases, there is no difference between the collectivising/conjugating
processes in Old and Modern Kannada.

This investigation of the collectivising/conjugating suffixes, `um` in Old Kannada and `ū` in Modern Kannada,
not only shows that these collectivising/conjugating suffixes are originally derived from the presentative pronominal root `um̐`/`ũ`,
but also clarifies the variation in the collectivising/conjugating processes between Old and Modern Kannada in the accusative case,
the lack of such variation in the other cases.
This gives a glimpse of the depth of the semantics of the pronominal roots and the wide-ranging breadth of use Kannada has put them into.

### Indo-European Languages

Though the Dravidian third-person demonstrative pronominal root vowels, the distal `a`, the proximal `i` and the medial `u`,
are found in [Indo-European languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages) too,
their form and derivation doesn't seem to be as systematic as in the Dravidian languages,
as can be seen in the following sample (please note that this is not a complete list by any means;
it is presented here only for the purpose of comparison).
It is interesting to note that the vowel `i` appears most often in the proximal demonstrative pronominal forms
and the vowel `a` or `u` appear most often in the distal demonstrative pronominal forms, even in the Indo-European languages.

## Summary

Kannada and other Dravidian languages systematically use the nasalised vowels `am̐`/`ə̃`, `im̐`/`ĩ`, `um̐`/`ũ`, `æm̐`/`æ̃` (and their longer forms `ām̐`/`ɑ̃ː`, `īm̐`/`ĩː`, `ūm̐`/`ũː`, `ǣm̐`/`æ̃ː`) as distal, proximal, medial [demonstrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstrative) third-person, second-person, first-person and [interrogative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogative_word#Interrogative_pronoun) pronominal roots.
Other language families (for example, Indo-European), also use these but less systematically.
In other words,

- The distal demonstrative `am̐`/`ə̃` is the distral demonstrative pronominal root.
In Kannada, it is also the [accusative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accusative_case) suffix.
- The proximal demonstrative `im̐`/`ĩ`, medial/[*presentative*](https://ygdp.yale.edu/phenomena/dative-presentatives) `um̐`/`ũ` are the proximal and medial/*presentative* demonstrative pronominal roots correspondingly.
They both (`im̐`/`ĩ` and `um̐`/`ũ`) are also the second-person pronominal roots.
Among them, in Kannada, `im̐`/`ĩ` is also the root of the `iṁ` suffix which is widely known as the [instrumental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_case) suffix but really is also the [ablative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablative_case) suffix.
- The *presentative* `um̐`/`ũ` is also used as the *collectivising*/*conjunctive* suffix (`uṁ` in [Old Kannada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Kannada) and `ū` in modern Kannada)
- Self-referential `æm̐`/`æ̃` is the first-person pronominal root.
It is also the root of the *emphasising* suffix `ē`.
- `æm̐`/`æ̃` with an interrogative tone is the interrogative pronominal root.
It is also the root of the interrogative/*speculative*/*skeptical* suffixes `ā`, `ē`, `ō`.

This hypothesis, on the one hand, takes the provenance of of the pronouns back to a pre-historical (perhaps even a *proto-linguistic*) time and one the other, to baby-talk.
That these nasalised vowels are naturally suited to signify the above mentioned semantics can be pictorially represented as follows.
