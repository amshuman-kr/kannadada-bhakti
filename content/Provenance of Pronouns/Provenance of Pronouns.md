# Provenance of Pronouns

## Background

As [mentioned](Introduction%20and%20Context.md#note) in the [Introduction and Context](Introduction%20and%20Context.md) section,
due to the complexity and subtlety involved in the investigation of the pronoun forms of Kannada and other Dravidian languages,
this document has become unavaoidably detailed and long.
So, for the ease of access, publishing, collaboration, revision tracking as well as for some technical reasons, this document has been split into two parts.
- [Introduction and Context](Introduction%20and%20Context.md) - A brief introduction to the topic and the context for this investigation,
such as a listing of the various pronoun forms in Kannada and other Dravidian languages and highlights of some relevant existing scholarly work can be seen here.
- [Provenance of Pronouns](#provenance-of-pronouns) - The current document.
The actual investigation of pronoun roots of Kannada and other Dravidian languages.
This section refers to the relevant parts from the [Introduction and Context](Introduction%20and%20Context.md) section as required during the investigation of the pronoun roots of Kannada and other Dravidian languages. 

## ಅನುವಾದದ ಕುರಿತು / About Translation

ಈ ಲೇಖನವು ಮೊದಲು ಕನ್ನಡದಲ್ಲಿ ಪ್ರಕಾಶಿತವಾಗಿದ್ದು, ಆ ಕನ್ನಡದ ಆವೃತ್ತಿಯನ್ನು [ಇಲ್ಲಿ](../ಸರ್ವನಾಮಗಳ%20ಸರ್ಗ/ಸರ್ವನಾಮಗಳ%20ಸರ್ಗ.md) ನೋಡಬಹುದು.

This document was originally published in Kannada and that original Kannada version can be seen [here](../ಸರ್ವನಾಮಗಳ%20ಸರ್ಗ/ಸರ್ವನಾಮಗಳ%20ಸರ್ಗ.md).

This is a partial and progressive English translation of the original Kannada document.
Due to time constraint, I plan to translate one section at a time.
I apologize for the inconvenience caused by this approach to translation.

## About Transliteration

Kannada and other Dravidian words and word fragments are transliterated in this document using [ISO 15919](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_15919) wherever possible and is unambiguous.
Where ISO 15919 transliteration is unclear or ambiguous, IPA transliteration has also been given alongside the ISO 15919 transliteration.

For example, the [anusvara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anusvara) is transliterated as `ṁ` in ISO 15919 but the pronunciation may not be clear because in most dialects of Kannada
This is workable for Kannada words because the pronunciation is fairly clear to most Kannada speakers.
Nasalisation is similarly transliterated as `m̐`  in ISO 15919 but the pronunciation may not be clear to many Kannada speakers because the nasalisation has now been mostly lost in many dialects.
So, to make it clear at least in the transliteration, IPA transliteration (`​̃​ `) has been given alongside the ISO 15919 transliteration (e.g. `am̐`/`ə̃`, `ǣm̐`/`æ̃ː` etc.)

## Summary

Kannada and other Dravidian languages systematically use the nasalised vowels `am̐`/`ə̃`, `im̐`/`ĩ`, `um̐`/`ũ`, `æm̐`/`æ̃` (and their longer forms `ām̐`/`ɑ̃ː`, `īm̐`/`ĩː`, `ūm̐`/`ũː`, `ǣm̐`/`æ̃ː`) as distal, proximal, medial [demonstrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstrative) third-person, second-person, first-person and [interrogative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogative_word#Interrogative_pronoun) pronominal roots.
Other language families (for example, Indo-European), also use these but less systematically.
In other words,

- The distal demonstrative `am̐`/`ə̃` is the distral demonstrative pronominal root.
In Kannada, it is also the [accusative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accusative_case) suffix.
- The proximal demonstrative `im̐`/`ĩ`, medial/[*presentative*](https://ygdp.yale.edu/phenomena/dative-presentatives) `um̐`/`ũ` are the proximal and medial/*presentative* demonstrative pronominal roots correspondingly.
They both (`im̐`/`ĩ` and `um̐`/`ũ`) are also the second-person pronominal roots.
Among them, in Kannada, `im̐`/`ĩ` is also the root of the `iṁ` suffix which is widely known as the [instrumental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_case) suffix but really is also the [ablative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablative_case) suffix.
- The *presentative* `um̐`/`ũ` is also used as the *collectivising*/*conjunctive* suffix (`uṁ` in [Old Kannada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Kannada) and `ū` in modern Kannada)
- Self-referential `æm̐`/`æ̃` is the first-person pronominal root.
It is also the root of the *emphasising* suffix `ē`.
- `æm̐`/`æ̃` with an interrogative tone is the interrogative pronominal root.
It is also the root of the interrogative/*speculative*/*skeptical* suffixes `ā`, `ē`, `ō`.

This hypothesis, on the one hand, takes the provenance of of the pronouns back to a pre-historical (perhaps even a *proto-linguistic*) time and one the other, to baby-talk.
That these nasalised vowels are naturally suited to signify the above mentioned semantics can be pictorially represented as follows.
