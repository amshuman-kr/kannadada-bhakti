## About Transliteration

Kannada and other Dravidian words and word fragments are transliterated in this document using [ISO 15919](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_15919) wherever possible and is unambiguous.
Where ISO 15919 transliteration is unclear or ambiguous, IPA transliteration has also been given alongside the ISO 15919 transliteration.

For example, the [anusvara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anusvara) is transliterated as `ṁ` in ISO 15919 but the pronunciation may not be clear because in most dialects of Kannada
This is workable for Kannada words because the pronunciation is fairly clear to most Kannada speakers.
Nasalisation is similarly transliterated as `m̐`  in ISO 15919 but the pronunciation may not be clear to many Kannada speakers because the nasalisation has now been mostly lost in many dialects.
So, to make it clear at least in the transliteration, IPA transliteration (`​̃​ `) has been given alongside the ISO 15919 transliteration (e.g. `am̐`/`ə̃`, `ǣm̐`/`æ̃ː` etc.)

## Introduction

The [third-person](https://www.grammar-monster.com/glossary/third_person.htm) pronoun forms (distal [demonstrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstrative) `avanu`, `avaḷu`, `adu`, `avaru`, `avu` and proximal demonstrative `ivanu`, `ivaḷu`, `idu`, `ivaru`, `ivu` etc.) indicating grammatical [gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender) and [number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_number) in [Kannada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada) are begin with a vowel and seem to be produced by well-defined production rules.
It is easy to see that these are produced when the [demonstrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstrative) vowels, `a` ([distal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determiner#Distal_demonstratives)) and `i` ([proximal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determiner#Proximal_demonstratives) get appended with suffixes of grammatical gender and number (`an`, `aḷ`, `d`, `ar`, `m`/`v` etc.) with some euphonic processes mediating the suffixing where necessary.
This is accepted by most grammarians and linguists.
But while the [second-person](https://www.grammar-monster.com/glossary/second_person.htm) pronouns start only with the consonant `n` (`nīnu`, `nīvu`), the [first-person](https://www.grammar-monster.com/glossary/first_person.htm) pronouns have variants starting with the consonant `n` (`nānu`, `nāvu`) as well as those starting with a vowel (`ānu`, `ām`/`āvu`).
Similarly, the [interrogative pronouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogative_word#Interrogative_pronoun) also have variants starting with the consonant `y` (`yāvudu`, `yāru`, `yāke` etc.) as well as those starting with a vowel (`ēnu`, `ēke` etc.)

This document is an investigation into the reasons behind this regularity in the third-person pronouns and the variety and variations in the second, first person and interrogative pronouns.

### Note

Due to the complexity and subtlety involved in the investigation of the pronoun forms in Kannada and other [Dravidian languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravidian_languages), this document has become unavoidably detailed and long.
So, for the ease of access, publishing, collaboration, revision tracking as well as for some technical reasons, this document has been split into two parts.
- [Introduction and Context](#provenance-of-pronouns) - The current document.
A brief introduction to the topic and the context for this investigation, such as a listing of the various pronoun forms in Kannada and other Dravidian languages and highlights of some relevant existing scholarly work can be seen here.
- [Provenance of Pronouns](Provenance%20of%20Pronouns.md) - The actual investigation of pronoun roots of Kannada and other Dravidian languages.
This section refers to the relevant parts from the [Introduction and Context](#provenance-of-pronouns) section as required during the investigation of the pronoun roots of Kannada and other Dravidian languages. 

## Context

### Kannada Pronominal Forms

As a referance for the upcoming investigation and discussion, most of the first-person, second-person,  third-person, interrogative
and [reflexive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexive_pronoun) pronominal forms found in [Old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Kannada),
[Middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada#Middle_Kannada) and [Modern Kannada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada#Modern_Kannada),
including their grammatical [case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_case), gender and number variations are given below.
For the sake of brevity, some of the regional/dialectical variations in the pronominal forms ([accusative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accusative_case) `anna` suffix, [locative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locative_case) `oḷage`/`oḷaga`, `āge`/`āga` suffix) have been omitted.
The third-person masculine and feminine singular forms based on `āta`/`īta`, `āke`/`īke` have also been omittted because I do not have clarity about their provenance and derivation yet (I will be grateful if knowledgeable readers share more information about these forms).

The [ablative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablative_case) forms with the `attaṇiṁ` (Old Kannada) and `deseyiṁda` have been omitted because they are unnatural in spoken (to some extent even in written) language and remain restricted only to historical linguistic or grammatical academic works.
More details about this can be seen [here]().

#### Second-person, First-person and Reflexive Pronouns

In his book [śabdamaṇidarpaṇaṁ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabdamanidarpana) on Old Kannada grammar, [kēśirāja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesiraja)
explicitly mentions only `nīṁ`/`nīn` (only the forms starting with the consonant `n`), `āṁ`/`ān` (only the forms starting with a vowel) and `tāṁ`/`tān`
for the second-person, first-person and reflexive pronouns respectively.

###### Summary

In the nominative case, the second-person, first-person and the reflexive pronouns are `nīṁ`/`nīn`, `āṁ`/`ānu`, `tāṁ`/`tān` respectively.
In the dative case, the inflected forms `nin`, `en`, `tan` with an `a` suffix (i.e. `nina`, `ena`, `tana`), appear as substitutes,
producing `ninage`, `enage`, `tanage`.
In the rest of the grammatical cases, the inflected forms `nin`, `en`, `tan` without the `a` suffix, appear as substitutes.

#### First-person Pronouns

For the third-person/demonstrative pronominal forms, kēśirāja not only mentions the well-known distal `a` and proximal `i`,
but also the medial `u` forms.

###### Sumary

The neuter gender pronouns `adu`, `idu`, `udu` produce the masculine forms `avaṁ`, `ivaṁ`, `uvaṁ` when `v` substitutes the ending `du`.
In the rational plural, these become `avar`, `ivar`, `uvar`.
The alternative masculine forms `āta`, `īta`, `ūta` are produced when the same `du` is substituted by `ta` while the starting vowel gets elongated.
In the plural, these become `ātaṁgaḷ`, `ītaṁgaḷ`, `ūtaṁgaḷ`.

The third-person, medial demonstrative (`u`) pronominal forms would be as follows if they are similar to the other two (distal and proximal) demonstrative pronominal forms.

The medial demonstrative determiner form is `ū`.

#### Interrogative Pronoun

For the interrogative pronouns, kēśirāja explicitly mentions only the forms that start with a vowel.

### Robert Caldwell

#### Third-person Pronouns

On the topic of the third-person pronouns, the positions of kēśirāja and that of [Robert Caldwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Caldwell) in his book
"[A Comparative grammar of the Dravidian](https://archive.org/details/acomparitivegrammarofdravidianlanguagesrobertcaldwell1856bookmark_589_l/mode/2up)"
are complementary to each other.

##### "A Comparative grammar of the Dravidian", Chapter "Pronouns", Page [332](https://archive.org/details/acomparitivegrammarofdravidianlanguagesrobertcaldwell1856bookmark_589_l/page/332/mode/2up)

> Four demonstrative bases are recognised by one or another of the Drâvidian dialects, each of which is a pure vowel; viz., 'a,' the remote, 'i,' the proximate, and 'u,' the medial demonstrative; together with 'ê,' which is the suffix of emphasis in most of the dialects, but is a demonstrative in Ku. The first two, viz., 'a,' the remote, and 'i,' the proximate demonstrative, are the most widely and frequently used.

> The medial 'u' is occasionally used by the Tamil poets, in Ancient Canarese, and in Tulu, to denote a person or object which is intermediate between the remote and the proximate; and it will be found that it has ulterior affinities of its own. 'ê,' the ordinary Drâvidian suffix of emphasis, is used as a demonstrative in Ku alone, - in addition however to 'a' and 'i,' e.g., 'êvaru,' they. ...

> The ordinary remote and proximate demonstratives of the Drâvidian dialects are the simple, short vowels 'a' and 'i;' and it will be found that every other form which they assume is derived from this by some euphonic process.

#### First-person Singular Pronouns

The variety of the first-person singular pronominal forms (forms starting with a vowel as well as those starting with a consonant)
seems to have bothered Caldwell too.
He has deliberated on this quite extensively.
Since his work is crucial to the investigation of the first and second person pronominal roots, I have quoted his work in some detail (from six pages) below.
I beg the readers' indulgence for the lengthy quotation.

##### "A Comparative grammar of the Dravidian", Chapter "Pronouns", Page [292](https://archive.org/details/acomparitivegrammarofdravidianlanguagesrobertcaldwell1856bookmark_589_l/page/292/mode/2up)

> Comparison of dialects. - Our first inquiry must be 'What was the primitive form of this pronoun in the Drâvidian languages?'

> In Tamil the form which is used in the colloquial dialect is 'nân,' the inflexion of which is not 'nan,' as might have been expected, but 'en;' and this inflexion 'en' indicates the original existence of a nominative in 'ên.' Though 'ên' is no longer found in a separate shape, it survives in the inflexions of verbs; in which the sign of the first person singular is 'ên,' sometimes poetically shortened to 'en.'

> In the higher dialects of Tamil 'yân' is more commonly used than 'nân,' the inflexion of which is not 'yan' but 'en,' as in the colloquial dialect.*

> From the examples which have been adduced above, it would appear that there are three forms of the pronoun of the first person singular recognised in Tamil, viz., 'nân,' 'yân' and  'ên.' The first of these forms, though the most common, was probably the primitive one: its initial 'n' was first, I think, softened to 'y,' and finally abandoned. It is not easy to determine whether the included vowel of this pronoun was originally 'â' or 'ê.' A comparison of the corresponding plurals 'nâm,' 'yâm,' and 'em' (the inflexion of 'êm'), and of the plural terminations of the verb 'ôm,' 'âm,' 'am' and 'em,' leads to the conclusion that 'â' was most probably the original vowel.

> ... The final 'ôm' ... could not well have been corrupted from 'êm,' but would spring naturally enough from 'âm;' and of this we have a proof in the circumstance that 'âm' (from 'âgum,' it is, yes) is also sometimes converted into 'ôm.' Moreover, whilst there are many instances of the change of 'a' into 'e' of 'ei,' there is not any of the converse. ...

> <sub>[Continues in page [294](https://archive.org/details/acomparitivegrammarofdravidianlanguagesrobertcaldwell1856bookmark_589_l/page/294/mode/2up).]</sub>

> --- [Footnote]
> \* In explanation of the abbreviated form of the noun called 'the inflexion,' which has been referred to above, it may here be repeated that in the personal and reflexive pronouns of the Tamil, Canarese, Malayâlam and Tulu, and in the reflexive pronoun of the Telugu, the 'inflexion,' or basis of the oblique cases (which by itself denotes the genitive, and to which the signs of all other cases are suffixed), is formed by simply shortening the long included vowel of the nominative. The included vowel of each of the personal pronouns is naturally long; and if in any instance the nominative has disappeared whilst the inflexion remains, we have only to lengthen the short vowel of the 'inflexion,' in order to discover the nominative from which it was derived.

##### "A Comparative grammar of the Dravidian", Chapter "Pronouns", Page [294](https://archive.org/details/acomparitivegrammarofdravidianlanguagesrobertcaldwell1856bookmark_589_l/page/294/mode/2up)

> ... I conclude, therefore, that 'â' was originally the included vowel of the Tamil pronoun of the first person, and that 'nân,' the ordinary colloquial form of the pronoun, is the most faithful representative of the primitive Tamil I. As we proceed in our comparison of these dialects, it will be found that the evidence is cumulative and gathers strength as we proceed. It might appear, indeed, at first sight that 'yân' was an older form than 'nân;' but before our investigation is concluded, we shall be convinced, I think, that the 'n' is radical. 'n' is known to change into 'y;' but 'y' evinces no tendency to be changed into 'n.'

> In Malayâlam, the nominative is 'ñjân' ('ny,' 'jñ,' or 'ñj,' the nasal of the palatal 'varga,' is to be pronounced as one letter, like the 'ni' of onion); but the oblique form, or inflexion, is 'en' as in Tamil, except in the dative inikka in which 'en' is altered to 'in.' The ordinary Malayâla verb is destitute of personal endings: but in the poetry an inflected form of the verb is occasionally used, in which the pronominal termination of the first person singular is 'ên,' precisely as in Tamil.

> The compound sound of 'ñj' or 'ny,' in the Malayâla  'ñjân' or 'nyân' is a middle point between 'n' of 'nân,' and the 'y' of 'yân.' It is a softened and nasalised form of 'n,' from which the change to 'y' is easily made. In like manner, 'nîn,' the original form of the pronoun of the second person singular in all the Drâvidian dialects, has become in Tamil, first 'nîÿ,' then 'nî;' and in the verbal terminations 'aiy,' 'i,' and 'ei.'

> In Canarese, the nominative of this pronoun which is used in the colloquial dialect is 'nân-u,' as in Tamil, the inflexion of which (as seen in 'nanna,' my) is 'nan.' The ancient dialect uses 'ân,' the inflexion of which is 'en' - identical with that of the Tamil. 'ân' is evidently softened from the Tamil 'yân,' as 'yân' from 'nyân,' or 'ñjân,' and that from 'nân'; and the same softening is apparent in the Canarese plural 'âm'  (instead of 'yâm' or 'nâm'), we. The crude form of this pronoun ('nâ') is sometimes used in Canarese as a nominative, instead of 'nânu;' e.g., 'nâ bandenu,' I came; and in the same manner in Tamil, 'nî,' the crude form of 'nîn,' thou, has altogether superseded 'nîn.' The pronominal terminations of the first person singular of the Canarese verb are 'en' in the ancient dialect, and 'êne,' 'ênu,' and 'enu' in the modern.

> The Tulu nominative is 'yân,' the inflexion 'yân,' the pronominal ending of the verb 'e,' which is probably softened from 'en.'

> In Telugu the nominative of this pronouns is 'nên-u;' in the higher dialect 'ênu' (answering to 'ên,' the Tamil-Canarese pronominal ending of the verb and 'en,' the Tamil and Ancient Canarese inflexion); and this preference of 'ê' to 'â' appears also in the plural, which is 'mêm-u,' and in the higher dialect 'êmu.' 'nê' may be used at pleasure instead of 'nên-u,' like 'nâ' in Canarese; and in the higher dialect 'ên-u' is sometimes represented by 'ê' alone.

> The verbal inflexions of the Telugu, use only the final syllable of the nominative of each of the pronouns, viz., 'nu' (from 'nênu,' I), 'vu' (from 'nîvu,', thou), and 'ḍu' (from 'vâḍu,' he). The most important and essential part of each pronoun has thus been omitted; and the fragments which have been retained are merely formatives, or at most signs of gender and number.

> 'nênu,' I, takes 'nâ' for its inflexion or oblique form; and this shows that 'â' and not 'ê' was originally the included vowel in Telugu, as well as in Tamil and Canarese. This view is corroborated by the accusative of this pronoun in Telugu, which is 'nanu' or 'nannu,' me, (compare the Canarese accusative 'nanna' or 'nannu'), and which has evidently been derived from a nominative, 'nân' or 'nâ.'

> ...

> root. This conclusion will be found to gain strength from the investigation of the pronoun of the second person, the root of which will appear to be not 'î' or 'yî,' but 'nî.'

> Each consonant of 'nân' evinces a tendency to be softened away. The initial 'n,' though the more essential of the two, has been softened into 'dñj' or 'ny,' then into 'y,' and finally has disappeared; and in none of the dialects has it, or any relic of it, been retained in the personal terminations of the verb.

> The final 'n,' though not a part of the root, has shown itself more persistent, especially in the verbal terminations; but in the Telugu and Ku inflexion 'nâ,' in the Canarese crude nominative 'nâ,' and in the corresponding Telugu 'nê,' it has disappeared altogether.

> merely a sign of number, or as an euphonic formative, it might appear extraordinary, that in the pronominal terminations of the verb, the initial 'n,' the primitive sign of the personality has invariably and altogether disappeared; whilst the first person singular is represented by the final 'n' alone. We might almost be led to suppose the initial 'n' to be a formative prefix, and the succeeding vowel to be the real pronominal base. Formative and definitive pre-fixes, however, are utterly unknown to the Dravidian languages; ... Another and still more reliable illustration of this anamaly is furnished by the Telugu itself. The pronoun of the second person singular in Telugu is 'nîvu,' thou, from 'nî,' the radical base, and 'vu' an euphonic addition. This 'vu' is of so little importance that it totally disappears in all the oblique cases. Nevertheless, it forms the regular termination of the second person singular of the Telugu verb; and it has acquired this use simply through the accident of position, seeing that it has not even a sign of number, much less of personality, but is merely an euphonisation.

So, according to Caldwell, the main forms of first-person pronoun in Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam, Tulu and Telugu are as follows.

&nbsp; | Kannada | Tamil | Malayalam | Tulu | Telugu
:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--
Nominative | nān/nā/nānu<br/>ān/ānu | nān<br/>yān | ñān | yān | nēnu/nē<br/>ēnu/ē
Inflexional substitute | nan<br/>en | en | en | yān | nan
Grammatical gender suffixes of finite verb forms | en/enu/ēne/ēnu | en/ēn | ēn | e | na

#### Second-person Singular Pronoun

Though not as much as in the case of the first-person pronouns, the second-person pronominal forms have bothered Caldwell to some extent.
He has deliberated on these too.
Since his work is crucial to the investigation of these pronominal roots, I have quoted his work in some detail (from five pages) below.
I, again, beg the readers' indulgence for the lengthy quotation.

> In Canarese not only are 'nâ' and 'nî' regarded as the crude bases of the pronouns of the first and second persons, but they are occasionally used also as nominatives of verbs instead of 'nân' and 'nîn.'

> In the personal terminations of the verb, this pronoun is much changed in all the Drâvidian dialects. It not only loses its initial 'n,' like the pronoun of the first person; but its final 'n' also disappears. Generally nothing remains in the verbal inflexions but the included vowel, and that also is more or less modified by use. In the Cana-

> rese verb it appears as 'i,' 'î,' 'îye,' and 'e:' in the ancient dialect of the Canarese it is 'âÿ,' as in Tamil.

> In Tamil 'nî,' which is properly the crude base, is invariably used as the isolated nominative, instead of 'nîn' - the form which would correspond by rule to 'nân,' the nominative of the first person singular. That 'nîn' originally constituted the nominative even in Tamil, appears from this that the oblique cases in the higher dialect agree in using 'nin' (shortened by rule from 'nîn') as the base to which the case suffixes are attached. ... In the colloquial obliques the initial 'n' entirely disappears, and does not leave even a 'y' behind it, as the initial 'n' of the first personal pronoun generally does. When the initial is discarded, the included vowel changes from 'i' to 'u.' 'u,' however, constitutes the included vowel of this pronoun, not only when the initial 'n' is lost, but sometimes, in the higher dialect, even when it is retained. 'nin,' 'nun,' and 'un' are severally used as the bases of the oblique cases. In the personal terminations of the Tamil verb, this pronoun is represented by the suffixes 'âÿ,' 'ei,' or 'i:' from each of which suffixes the final 'n,' as well as the initial, has disappeared. ...

> The root of the verb is regularly used in Tamil as the second person singular of the imperative, without any pronominal suffix, and even without any euphonic addition: but the second person plural of the imperative in the colloquial dialect is formed by the addition of 'um' (the ordinary plural base of the oblique cases); which 'um' is derived from a singular form in 'un,' one of the bases of the oblique cases already referred to. ...

> With respect to the consonantal elements of the pronoun of the second person, there is little room to doubt that they consisted in an initial and final 'n,' the former essential, the latter formative: but there seems to be some doubt with respect to the included vowel. Authority preponderates in favour of 'i;' 'u' ranks next, and 'â' next to that; but 'ei' and 'e' are also found. Sometimes in Tamil, 'î' is converted in pronunciation into a sound resembling 'û;' whilst the converse never takes place. It may therefore perhaps be concluded that 'i' constituted the included vowel of the original base of this pronoun.

> ... In Malayâlam the nominative of this pronoun is 'nî;' but 'nin' is used, as in classical Tail, in the oblique cases. The dative has 'nan,' instead of nin; e.g., 'nanikka,' to thee - as if from a nominative in 'nan,' with 'a' as the included vowel. This use of 'a' is in accordance with the colloquial Tamil personal termination of the web, which is 'âÿ,' instead of 'îÿ.'

> In Tulu the nominative is 'î;' but the oblique cases are formed upon the base of 'ni' or 'nin.' The personal terminations of the verb in the second person singular is represented by 'a.' The Tulu nominative 'î' illustrates the fact already stated that each of the nasals of 'nîn' (both the radical initial and the formative final) has sometimes been worn off.

> ... The Telugu nominative is 'nîvu,' expanded from 'nî' by the addition of the euphonic particle 'vu:' 'nîvu,' Tel., thou, is identical in form, though not in meaning, with the modern Canarese plural of the same pronoun, viz., ;nîvu,' you. In the oblique cases the Telugu rejects the euphonic addition of 'vu,' and uses 'nî' as its inflexional base, and also as its possessive. The objective alone follows the example of the other dialects in abbreviating the included vowel, and appending a final nasal. That case is 'ni-nu,' 'nin-u,' or 'nin-nu,' and is evidently formed from a nominative 'nîn-u.' In the higher dialect of Telugu, 'îvu,' from an old nominative 'î,' which is identical with the Tulu, is occasionally used instead of 'nîvu.'

> ... In the personal terminations of the verb, the Telugu rejects every portion of the pronominal root, and employs only the euphonic addition 'vu' or 'vi.'

> ... On a comparison of the various Drâvidian dialects we arrive at the conclusion that the primitive form of this pronouns was 'nî,' 'nû,' or 'na;' - most probably the first. The only essential part of the pronoun appears to be the initial consonant 'n;' just as in the Indo-European languages 't' is the only essential part of the corresponding pronoun. In each family the vowel by the help of which the initial consonant is enunciated varies considerably, but evinces, on the whole, a preference for 'i' in the Dravidian languages, for 'u; in the Indo-European.

> to be the primitive form of the Drâvidian pronoun of the first person, it is deserving of notice that the only difference between the two is the difference between the two included vowels, 'a' and 'i.' ... The method adopted by the Dravidian languages of expressing the difference between the first person and the second by means of of the vowel 'a' and 'i,' used as auxiliaries, does not appear to be the result of accident. It is probably founded on some ultimate principle; Though it may be difficult or impossible now to discover what that principle is.

> If 'a' and 'i' be considered as identical with the demonstratives, an idea which would suit the signification, and which is corroborated by the circumstance that 'u' is also a demonstrative, we are met by the apparently insurmountable difficulty that in all the Drâvidian tongues, and (as far as the use of these demonstrative vowels extends) in all the tongues of the Indo-European family, 'a' is not the proximate, but the remote, demonstrative; and 'i' is not the remote, but the proximate; whilst 'u' is used in Tamil as an intermediate between these two.

> Is any weight to be attributed to the circumstances that 'a' has naturally the first place in all lists of vowels, and 'i' the second?

So, according to Caldwell, the main forms of the second-person pronoun in Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam, Tulu and Telugu are as follows.

&nbsp; | Kannada | Tamil | Malayalam | Tulu | Telugu
:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--
Nominative | nīn/nī/nīnu | nī | nī | ī | nīvu<br/>īvu
Inflexional substitute | nin | nin<br/>nun</br>un | nin | ni/nin | nī/nin
Grammatical gender suffixes of finite verb forms | i/ī/īye/e/ay | āy/ai/i | āy/īy | a | vu/vi

The first, second and third person plural and reflexive pronominal forms have been omitted for brevity because they don't seem provide additional fresh insight regarding their pronominal roots.

#### Interrogative Pronouns

On the topic of interrogative pronominal forms in Dravidian languages, Caldwell (similar to kēśirāja) considers mainly the forms that start with a vowel.
Elaborating the rationale for this, he notes the systematic logic of production of the different pronominal forms in Dravidian languages and mentions that,
on the topic of pronouns, Dravidian languages might shed light on pronominal forms older than [Proto-Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language).

> Interrogative pronouns and adjectives resolve themselves in tthe Drâvidian tongues into interrogative prefixes, resembling the demonstrative prefixes already considered, by suffixing to which the formatives of number and gender we form interrogative pronouns.

> (1.) The first and simplest interrogative prefix is the vowel 'e.'

> In all the Drâvidian dialects this prefix is used in the formation of pronominal, in precisely the same manner as the demonstrative bases 'a' and 'i.' It forms one of a set of three vocalic prefixes ('a', 'i', 'e'), which occupy one and the same position, obey one and the same law, and differ only in the particular signification which is expressed by each.

> tongues are totally ignorant, tends to confirm the supposition which I have already expressed, that the Drâvidian family has retained some Pre-Sancrit elements of immense antiquity; and, in particular, that its demonstratives, instead of being borrowed from Sanscrit, represent those old Japhetic bases from which the primary demonstratives of the Sanscrit itself, as well as of various other members of Indo-European family were derived.

> ... In each of the Drâvidian languages, 'e' is commonly pronounced as 'ye,' and in Telugu this 'y' is often written as well as heard; but as this is a characteristic of all words in each of the dialects which begin with this vowel, and not of the interrogatives alone, it is evident that it is merely a peculiarity of pronunciation, and that the 'y' in question is not part of the interrogative base.

> ... (2.) The other interrogative of this class is 'yâ.'

> 'yâ' is not used at all in Telugu; but it is largely used in Canarese and somewhat more rarely in Tamil. ... The only use to which 'yâ' is put in the colloquial dialect of the Tamil, is that of forming the basis of interrogative pronouns; a complete set of which, in Tamil as well as in Canarese, are formed from from 'yâ;' e.g., 'yâvan,' 'quit?' 'yâvaḷ,' 'quce?' 'yâdu,' 'quid?' 'yâvar,' 'qui?' 'quce?' 'yâvei,' 'quce?' The Canarese interrogative pronouns accord with these, with a single unimportant exception. The neuters, singular and plural, of the Canarese are formed from 'yâva,' instead of 'yâ;' e.g., 'yâvadu,' 'quid?' for ('yâdu'), and 'yâvaru,' 'quce?' (for 'yâva'). This additional 'va' is evidently derived by imitation from the euphonic 'v' of 'yâvanu,' he, and its related forms; but it is out of place in connexion with the neuter, and is to be regarded as a corruption.

> In Tamil a peculiar usage with respect to the application of the epicene plural 'yâvar,' 'qui?' has obtained ground. It is largely used in the colloquial dialect with the signification of the singular, as well as that of the plural, though itself a plural only and without distinction of gender; and when thus used 'yâvar' is abbreviated to 'yâr;' e.g., 'avan yâr', who is he? (literally[,] he who?); 'avaḷ yâr,' who is she? 'yâr' has also been still further corrupted into 'âr,' especially in compounds.

> ... It has been conjectured that the Sanscrit 'ya,' though now a relative, was a demonstrative originally; and if ... the Drâvidian interrogatives ''e' and 'a' are originally demonstratives, it may be supposed that 'yâ' was also a demonstrative, though of this no direct evidence whatever now remains.

> Syntactic interrogatives, ... Another interrogative is required for the purpose of putting such inquiries as are expressed in English by a change in construction; e.g., is there? is it? by transposition from there is, it is. This species of interrogation is affected in all the Drâvidian languages in one and the same manner, viz., by suffixing 'â' to the noun, verb, or sentence which forms the principal subject of interrogation; and in these languages it is by suffix of 'â' alone, without any syntactic change, or change in the collocation of words that an interrogative verb or sentence differs from an affiramative one: e.g. compare the affirmative 'avan-tandân,' Tam., he gave, with 'avan-tandân-â?' did he give? and 'avan-â[-]tandân?' was it he that gave? ... This interrogative is never prefixed to nouns of pronominal, or used adjectivally; but is invariably post-fixed, like an enunciated or audible note of interrogation. ...

> ... I am inclined to consider 'â,' the Drâvidian interrogative, as derived from or at least as allied to, 'a' or 'â', the remote demonstrative of the same family. The quantity of the demonstrative 'a' is long or short as euphonic considerations may determine; and though the interrogative 'â' is always long, yet in consequence of its being used as a post-fix, it is pronounced long by necessity of position whatever it may been originally. ... The only real difference between them is the difference in location; 'a' demonstrative being invariably placed at the beginning of a word, 'a' interrogative at the end of it. ...

So, according to Caldwell, the main forms of the interrogative pronoun in Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam, Tulu and Telugu are as follows.

&nbsp; | Kannada | Tamil | Malayalam | Tulu | Telugu
:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--
Nominative | yāvanu,yāvaḷu/yāvudu,yāru | yāvan/yāvaḷ/yād/yār<br/>evan/evaḷ/ed/ēvar<br/>ār | yāvan/yāvaḷ/yār<br/>evan/evaḷ/ed/ēvar<br/>ār || evaḍu/ēdi/evaru

[Masti Venkatesha Iyengar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masti_Venkatesha_Iyengar), in his book "[namma nuḍi](https://www.sapnaonline.com/verify/books/namma-nudi-masti-venkatesha-8177470493-9788177470499)", has a slightly different take on the pronouns in Kannada and other Dravidian Languages than Robert Caldwell.

#### Summary

It is generally said that `ān`, `nān` of Tamil become `ēnu`, `nēnu` in Telugu.
It might be more appropriate to say that, originally, there was an intermediate vowel which descended as `ā` to one language and `ē` to the other.

In the rational plural (and [plurals of respect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_we)), an extra `gaḷ` suffix can appear, producing `nīṁgaḷ`, `avargaḷ` and the similar first-person version `nāṁgaḷ`.
Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam have this kind of two variations of the first-person plural which differ in [clusivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clusivity).
Kannada has similar two variations of the first-person plural but does not have the clusivity difference.

### Tulu Pronominal Forms

One of the main keys to unlocking the origins of the pronominal forms of Kannada and all the Dravidian languages seem to be hidden in the Tulu pronouns.
But Masti Venkatesha Iyengar has not discussed Tulu pronouns and Caldwell's discussion of Tulu pronouns is incomplete.
So, as a reference for the upcoming investigation, it is necessary to list the Tulu pronominal forms with their regional/dialectal variations.

For this, the "Pronouns" chapter (pages 142 through 162) of Dr. Padmanabha Kekunnaya's book "A Comparative Study of Tulu Dialects" is the source.
But for the sake of brevity, only the summary and the lists are given and the source text has not been quoted.

In pronouns and elsewhere, Tulu uses some vowels which are rare (almost lost) in Kannada.
Mainly, these are `ŭ`/`ɯ` and `æ`.
These vowels too have [short (`ɯ`/`ɯː`) and long (`æ`/`æː`)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_(phonetics)) forms.

More details about these exotic (in Indian Languages, i.e.) vowels can be seen [here](../ದ್ರಾವಿಡಭಾಷೆಗಳ%20ವಿಶೇಷಸ್ವರಗಳು.md). Please note that the document is in Kannada and is yet to be translated to English.

As Masti Venkatesha Iyengar mentions above, Tulu also has the two first-person plural forms which differ in clusivity,
though, like he notes, Kannada doesn't have the clusivity distinction between its two first-person plural forms.

#### First-person

&nbsp; | Singular | Plural, exclusive | Plural, inclusive

Grammatical gender suffixes of finite verb forms | e | aḷŭ | erŭ | (ŭ?)nŭ | o

The proximal demonstrative determiner form is `ī`.

#### Interrogative
