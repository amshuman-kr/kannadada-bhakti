## ಅನುವಾದದ ಕುರಿತು / About Translation

ಈ ಲೇಖನವು ಮೊದಲು ಕನ್ನಡದಲ್ಲಿ ಪ್ರಕಾಶಿತವಾಗಿದ್ದು, ಆ ಕನ್ನಡದ ಆವೃತ್ತಿಯನ್ನು [ಇಲ್ಲಿ](../ಸರ್ವನಾಮಗಳ%20ಸರ್ಗ/ಪ್ರಸ್ತಾವನೆ%20ಮತ್ತು%20ಪೂರ್ವಪಕ್ಷ.md) ನೋಡಬಹುದು.

This document was originally published in Kannada and that original Kannada version can be seen [here](../ಸರ್ವನಾಮಗಳ%20ಸರ್ಗ/ಪ್ರಸ್ತಾವನೆ%20ಮತ್ತು%20ಪೂರ್ವಪಕ್ಷ.md).

This is a partial and progressive English translation of the original Kannada document.
Due to time constraint, I plan to translate one section at a time.
I apologize for the inconvenience caused by this approach to translation.

## About Transliteration

Kannada and other Dravidian words and word fragments are transliterated in this document using [ISO 15919](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_15919) wherever possible and is unambiguous.
Where ISO 15919 transliteration is unclear or ambiguous, IPA transliteration has also been given alongside the ISO 15919 transliteration.

For example, the [anusvara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anusvara) is transliterated as `ṁ` in ISO 15919 but the pronunciation may not be clear because in most dialects of Kannada
This is workable for Kannada words because the pronunciation is fairly clear to most Kannada speakers.
Nasalisation is similarly transliterated as `m̐`  in ISO 15919 but the pronunciation may not be clear to many Kannada speakers because the nasalisation has now been mostly lost in many dialects.
So, to make it clear at least in the transliteration, IPA transliteration (`​̃​ `) has been given alongside the ISO 15919 transliteration (e.g. `am̐`/`ə̃`, `ǣm̐`/`æ̃ː` etc.)

## Introduction

The [third-person](https://www.grammar-monster.com/glossary/third_person.htm) pronoun forms (`avanu`, `avaḷu`, `adu`, `avaru`, `avu`, `ivanu`, `ivaḷu`, `idu`, `ivaru`, `ivu` etc.) indicating grammatical [gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender) and [number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_number) in [Kannada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada) are begin with a vowel and seem to be produced by well-defined production rules.
It is easy to see that these are produced when the [demonstrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstrative) vowels, `a` (distal) and `i` (proximal) get appended with suffixes of grammatical gender and number (`an`, `aḷ`, `d`, `ar`, `m`/`v` etc.) with some euphonic processes mediating the suffixing where necessary.
This is accepted by most grammarians and linguists.
But while the [second-person](https://www.grammar-monster.com/glossary/second_person.htm) pronouns start only with the consonant `n` (`nīnu`, `nīvu`), the [first-person](https://www.grammar-monster.com/glossary/first_person.htm) pronouns have variants starting with the consonant `n` (`nānu`, `nāvu`) as well as those starting with a vowel (`ānu`, `ām`/`āvu`).
SImilarly, the [interrogative pronouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogative_word#Interrogative_pronoun) also have variants starting with the consonant `y` (`yāvudu`, `yāru`, `yāke` etc.) as well as those starting with a vowel (`ēnu`, `ēke` etc.)

This document is an investigation into the reasons behind this regularity in the third-person pronouns and the variety and variations in the second, first person and interrogative pronouns.

### Note

Due to the complexity and subtlety involved in the investigation of the pronoun forms in Kannada and other [Dravidian languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravidian_languages), this document has become unavoidably detailed and long.
So, for the ease of access, publishing, collaboration, revision tracking as well as for some technical reasons, this document has been split into two parts.
- [Introduction and Context](#introduction-and-context) - The current document.
A brief introduction to the topic and the context for this investigation, such as a listing of the various pronoun forms in Kannada and other Dravidian languages and highlights of some relevant existing scholarly work can be seen here.
- [Provenance of Pronouns](Provenance%20of%20Pronouns.md) - The actual investigation of pronoun roots of Kannada and other Dravidian languages.
This section refers to the relevant parts from the [Introduction and Context](#introduction-and-context) section as required during the investigation of the pronoun roots of Kannada and other Dravidian languages. 

## Continuation

As mentioned [above](#note), the actual investigation of the pronoun forms in Kannada and other Dravidian languages and other related topics is continued [here](Provenance%20of%20Pronouns.md).

## Revisions

- The [Introduction](#introduction) section is translated.
