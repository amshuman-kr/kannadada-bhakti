## About Transliteration

Kannada and other Dravidian words and morphemes are transliterated in this document using [ISO 15919](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_15919).
In normal text, I have used `w` as Kannada mostly uses the bilabial `w` as against the labiodental `v`.
But in examples, I have used `v` as ISO 15919 uses `v`.

## Introduction

The seemingly different but possibly related phenomena of `dvitvasandhi` ([gemination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemination) at word/[morpheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheme) boundaries),
`vakārāgama` ([epenthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epenthesis) `w`) and the distinct structure at the begining of the metrical units of native Kannada prosody (called [`aṁśagaṇa`](https://kn.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ಅಂಶಗಣ)),
have been already covered in the earlier article [A Nose for Nasalasation](A%20Nose%20For%20Nasalisation.md#the-gemination-found-in-accusative-suffix-annu)
But because nasalisation and the different transformations mediated by it are the main subject of that article
and the matter of gemination, epenthetic `v` and native Kannada prosody is scattered there.
it was necessary to collect those scattered discussions together and extend it in a fresh research article.
I hope the readers will bare with the inevitable repetition in this work undertaken for the sake or clarity.

## Structure of Metrical Units in Native Kannada Prosody

The [metrical units in the native Kannada prosody](https://kn.wikipedia.org/wiki/ಕನ್ನಡ_ಛಂದಸ್ಸು#ಅಚ್ಚ_ಕನ್ನಡ_ಛಂದಸ್ಸಿನ_ಮಟ್ಟುಗಳು)
are distinct from those in the [`syllabic` or `syllabo-quantitative` metres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_(poetry)#Qualitative_versus_quantitative_metre)
and [`quantitative`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit_prosody#Classification).
Such metrical units have come to be called [`aṁśagaṇa`](https://kn.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ಅಂಶಗಣ).
These units come under three categories, called, [`brahma`](https://kn.wikipedia.org/wiki/ಅಂಶಗಣ#ಬ್ರಹ್ಮಗಣ), [`viṣṇu`](https://kn.wikipedia.org/wiki/ಅಂಶಗಣ#ವಿಷ್ಣುಗಣ) and [`rudra`](https://kn.wikipedia.org/wiki/ಅಂಶಗಣ#ರುದ್ರಗಣ).
The [metrical feet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_(poetry)#Feet) of all these types metrical units
are stretched or shrunk to fit the rhythmic unit of the song (or [time signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_signature) in music).
But such stretching and shinking happens only towards the end of these metrical units; never at the beginning.

All such metrical units are considered valid only if their beginning satisfies one of the two constraints.

1. One [`heavy`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_weight) syllable - `gāḷi`, `teṅgu`, `rāma`, `kr̥ṣṇa` etc. 
(syllables with long vowels, `anusvāra`, `visarga` etc. or syllables before a consonant cluster aer considered as `heavy`).
1. Two `light` syllables - `beḷaku`, `neraḷu`, `kanaka`, `prathama` etc.

After such a beginning, if one, two or three syllables (either `light` or `heavy`) make for the `brahma`, `viṣṇu` and `rudra` metrical units respectively.
For example (here a `light` and `heavy` syllables are shown as `Da` and `Dum` respectively),

For `brahma` unit (4 variations),

- `gāḷi` - `DumDa`
- `beḷaku` - `DaDaDa`
- `cintā` - `DumDum`
- `prathamā` - `DaDaDum`

For `viṣṇu` unit (8 variations)

- `hāḍuta` - `DumDaDa`
- `harasuva` - `DaDaDaDa`
- `mātāḍu` - `DumDumDa`
- `alugāṭa` - `DaDaDumDa`
- `jāhnavī` - `DumDaDum`
- `janakajā` - `DaDaDaDum`
- `mātallē` - `DumDumDum`
- `buḍadallē` - `DaDaDumDum`

For `rudra` unit (16 variations)

- `māḍiruva` - `DumDaDaDa`
- `maraḷoḷage` - `DaDaDaDaDa`
- `kāḍilDada` - `DumDumDaDa`
- `neraḷiddare` - `DaDaDumDaDa`

There are 12 more such variations for the `rudra` unit, which are omitted here for the sake of brevity.

[Sediyapu Krishna Bhat](https://kn.wikipedia.org/wiki/ಸೇಡಿಯಾಪು_ಕೃಷ್ಣಭಟ್ಟ) in his pathbreaking work
"*Kannaḍachandassu*" on the native Kannada prosody
([Dr. Padekallu Vishnu Bhat](https://www.clubhouse.com/@padekallu?utm_medium=ch_profile&utm_campaign=wSPhDP4r4o-9Pe_zqseDBA-212445) has compiled this work in "*Sēḍiyāpu Chandassampuṭa*", along with another scholarly work "*chandōgati*" by Sediyapu),
discussing the structure of the metrical units in native Kannada prosody,
concludes that the main feature in them is the complete absense of `DaDum` syllabic pattern (i.e. a `light` syllable followed by a `heavy` one)
at the beginning of the metrical units.
I.e. according to Sediyapu Krishna Bhat, the real nature of the rule that such metrical units must start with either a single `heavy` syllable
or two `light` syllables is that,
no metrical units should ever start with a pattern of a `light` syllable followed by a `heavy` syllable.

### Sēḍiyāpu Chandassampuṭa, Page 297

Readers can themselves verify by going through all the variations of all the three types of the `aṁśagaṇa` matric units that none of them start with a `DaDum` pattern.
`DaDum` pattern are allowed after the begging of the metrical units, as can be seen in examples like `jāhnavī` (`DumDaDum`), `janakajā` (`DaDaDaDum`) etc. which are valid.

Additionally, it must be noted that in bisyllabic units, the first syllable is always `heavy`.
For example, `bāḷu`, `tenku` etc.
I.e. only two `light` syllables do not make for a valid metrical unit.
For example, `naḍe`, `hari`, by themselves, are not valid metrical units.

Discussing this matter further, Sediyapu Krishna Bhat proposes that such avoidance of `DaDum` rhythimc pattern
at the beginning of the metrical units, is a nature of not just the native Kannada prosody,
but is also a feature seen across native Dravidian prosody in general.
This seems to be the case, indeed.
This nature seems have influenced even the use of other imported (`syllablic`, `syllabo-quantitative` and `quantitative`) metres, where `DaDumDa` pattern (called `jagaṇa`, from the famous [`yāmātārājabhānasalaDum`](https://kannadakanaja-vyakarana.blogspot.com/2018/02/blog-post_28.html))
seems to avoided or reduced even when compared to their use in Sanskrit poetry.
When they do appear in the use of such imported meter in Kannada at the beginning of metrical units,
it often sounds jarring to the Kannada ears.

To be clear, this avoidance of `DaDum` pattern at the beginning of metrical units is not a universal feature across all languages.
For example, the famous English [`iambic pentameter`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iambic_pentameter) is actually based on the very same [`iambic`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iamb_(poetry)) (i.e. `DaDum`) unit.
English has [many such metres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iamb_(poetry)#Types_of_meter) based on the `iambic` unit.
Sanskrity prosody also has many metres starting with a `jagaṇa` (`DaDumDa`) or `yagaṇa` (`DaDumDum`) pattern.
Hence, this feature of avoiding `DaDum` pattern at the beginning of metrical units seems to be unique to only the native prosody of the Dravidian family of languages.

Sediyapu Krishna Bhat has proposed this feature of avoiding the `DaDum` pattern at the begging of metrical units only to analyse metrical units in the native Kannada prosody.
But this feature does not seem to be limited to the world of prosody.
It seems to influnce even the rules of grammar/linguistics and word formation.
Now let us examine the seemingly unrelated phenomena of `dvitvasandhi` ([gemination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemination) at word/[morpheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheme) boundaries) and
`vakārāgama` ([epenthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epenthesis) `w`) sometimes found in case inflexions.

## Gemination at morpheme boundaries

[Kēśirāja](https://kn.wikipedia.org/wiki/kēśirāja) describes the phenomenon of `dvitvasandhi` (gemination at morpheme boundaries),
in his work [`śabdamaṇidarpaṇa`](https://kn.wikipedia.org/wiki/kēśirāja#śabdamaṇidarpaṇa)
(verses [79](https://archive.org/details/abdamaidarpaa00kirjuoft/page/100/mode/2up), [80](https://archive.org/details/abdamaidarpaa00kirjuoft/page/102/mode/2up) and [81](https://archive.org/details/abdamaidarpaa00kirjuoft/page/104/mode/2up)).

The main feature here is that, when two morphene come together, if the first morpheme ends with a consonant, the consonant becomes geminated, if there is a single `light` syllable before that consonant.
There is not gemination if the ending consonant of the first morphene is preceded (not counting the ending consonant) by either a `heavy` syllable or multiple syllables.
For example,

No gemination when preceded by a single `heavy` syllable,

- `kāl + u => kālu` - `kā` before the ending `l` is `heavy`
- `mīn + aṁ => mīnaṁ` - `mī` before the ending `n` is `heavy'

No gemination when preceded by multiple syllables,

- `beral + u => beralu` - `bera` before the ending `l` multisyllabic.
- `toḍar + i => toḍari` - `toḍa` before the ending `r` multisyllabic.

Gemination when preceeded by a single `light` syllable,

- `al + i => alli` - `a` before the ending `l` is `light`
- `ben + u => bennu` - `be` before the ending `n` is `light`
- `hon + a => honna` - `ho` before the ending `n` is `light`
- `heṇ + in + a => heṇṇina` - `he` before the ending `ṇ` is `light`
- `maṇ + oḷage => maṇṇoḷage` - `ma` before the ending `ṇ` is `light`
- `kaṇ + inda => kaṇṇinda` - `ka` before the ending `ṇ` is `light`
- `tan + aṣṭakke => tannaṣṭakke` - `ta` before the ending `n` is `light`

It must be noted that, when an ending consonant is geminated before a preceding single `light` syllable,
the said `monosyllable` is reliably transformed into a `heavy` syllable irrespective of whether the said consonant is followed by a vowel of another consonant from beginning of the following morpheme
(a syllable preceding a consonant cluster or gemination qualifies as `heavy`).
Even the possibility of the occurrance of `DaDum` pattern at the beginning of the compound (word/morpheme) is thus eliminated.

To be sure, let us examine what would happen if the ending consonant is not geminated when preceded by a single `light` syllable, in some of the examples given above.

- `kaṇ + imda => kaṇinda` - *DaDum*Da
- `tan + aṣṭakke => tanaṣṭakke` - *DaDum*DumDa

These compound forms do not appear in Kannada because they manifest the `DaDum` pattern at the beginning.

However, it must be noted that formation of such `DaDum` pattern at the beginning is a possibility only is some of such compounds.
Sometimes a `DaDum` pattern may not manifest at the beginning of such compounds even when gemination is prevented (for the sake of argument).
In some of those cases, the compounds could be bisyllabic, made up of only two `light` syllables,
which is also not a valid metrical unit in native Kannada prosody, as discussed [above](#structure-of-metrical-units-in-native-kannada-prosody).
For example,

- `al + i => ali` - *DaDa*
- `ben + u => benu` - *DaDa*
- `hon + a => hona` - *DaDa*

These compounds too are not valid metrical units by themselves and are not seen in Kannada.

But even this too is only one among the possibilities.
Sometimes, even without gemination, the resulting compounds might be perfectly valid metrical units.
For example,

- `ben + anu => benanu` - *DaDaDa*
- `hon + ali => honali` - *DaDaDa*
- `heṇ + in + a => heṇina` - *DaDaDa*

But these forms are not seen in Kannada.
Suffix forms like `anu` `ali` etc. are found mostly when preceded by multiple syllable.
For example,`maravanu`, `rāmanali` etc.

The reason for this (such compound forms without gemination that are valid metrical units not occuring in Kannada) is that,
suffixes like `anu` `ali` are themselves further composed of smaller morphemes `aṁ`/`am̐`/`an`, `al`, `iṁ`/`im̐`/`in`.
Therefore, when the above exampels are examined in more details,
we can see that the `DaDum` pattern indeed forms in the intermediate compound, before disapparing from the proposed hypothetical final compound without gemination.
For example,

- `ben + aṁ/an + u => benaṁ/benan (DaDum) + u => benanu (DaDaDa)`
- `hon + al + i => honal (DaDum) + i =>  honali (DaDaDa)`
- `heṇ + in + a => heṇin (DaDum) + a => heṇina (DaDaDa)`

Thus, it looks like the `DaDum` pattern is avoid even in the intermediate compound forms in Kannada;
not just in the final compound forms.

### Note

The process behind the `-in` infix is discussed in detail in [A Nose for Nasalisation](A%20Nose%20for%20Nasalisation.md#the-in-infix-found-in-many-case-forms).

## Epenthetic `w` found in some case inflexions

An epenthetic `w` is sometimes found in the case inflexions of some nouns ending with a consonant or the vowel `u`. 
On closer examination, it can be seen that this too happens only when the last syllable of the noun is preceded by a single `light` syllable.
No epenthetic `w` is found when the last syllable of the noun is preceded by a single `heavy` syllable or multiple syllables (i.e. if the noun ends with the vowel `u`, that vowel is dropped according to the rules of [`lōpasandhi`](https://kn.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ಲೋಪಸಂಧಿ)).
For example,

No epenthetic `w` when preceded by a single `heavy` syllable,

- `mūḍu + aṇ + iṁ => mūḍaṇiṁ` - `mū` before `ḍu` is `heavy`
- `kāḍu + in + a => kāḍina` - `kā` before `ḍu` is `heavy`
- `kāl + annu => kālannu` - `kā` before `l` is `heavy`

No epenthetic `w` when preceded by multiple syllables,

- `baḍagu + aṇ + a => baḍagaṇa` - `baḍa` before `gu` is bisyllabic
- `maraḷu + in + a => maraḷina` - `mara` before `ḷu` is bisyllabic
- `haḍagu + annu => haḍagannu` - `haḍa` before `gu` is bisyllabic

Epenthetic `w` when preceded by a single `light` syllable,

- `naḍu + a => naḍuva` - `na` before `ḍu` is `light`
- `paḍu + aṇ + iṁ => paḍuvaṇiṁ` - `pa` before `ḍu` is `light`
- `hasu + in + a => hasuvina` - `ha` before `su` is `light`
- `karu + annu => karuvannu` - `ka` before `ru` is `light`

The process behind the `-iaṇn` infix is discussed in detail in [A Nose for Nasalisation](A%20Nose%20for%20Nasalisation.md#the-nasal-consonant-ṇ-sometimes-seen-in-directional-words).

The epenthetic `w` after two light syllables, ensures that the compound always starts with a `DaDa` pattern irresepective of whether the following morpheme starts with a consonant or vowel,
thus, eliminating even the possibility of a starting `DaDum` pattern.

To be sure, let us examine what would happen if such epenthetic `w` does not occur in such examples.
Since the first morpheme all end with the vowel `u`, dropping that vowel (`lōpasandhi`) is the only hypothetical alternative.

- `paḍu + alli => paḍalli` - *DaDum*Da
- `hasu + inda => hasinda` - *DaDum*Da
- `karu + annu => karannu` - *DaDum*Da

These compound forms do not appear in Kannada because they manifest the `DaDum` pattern at the beginning.

However, it must be noted that formation of such `DaDum` pattern at the beginning is a possibility only is some of such compounds.
Sometimes a `DaDum` pattern may not manifest at the beginning of such compounds even when the epenthetic `w` is prevented (for the sake of argument).
In some of those cases, the compounds could be bisyllabic, made up of only two `light` syllables,
which is also not a valid metrical unit in native Kannada prosody, as discussed [above](#structure-of-metrical-units-in-native-kannada-prosody).
For example,

- `naḍu + a => naḍa` - *DaDa*
- `karu + a => kara` - *DaDa*

These compounds too are not valid metrical units by themselves and are not seen in Kannada.

But even this too is only one among the possibilities.
Sometimes, even without the epenthetic `w`, the resulting compounds might be perfectly valid metrical units.
For example,

- `karu + anu => karanu` - *DaDaDa*
- `paḍu + ali => paḍali` - *DaDaDa*
- `naḍu + aṇ + a => naḍaṇa` - *DaDaDa*
- `hasu + in + a => hasina` - *DaDaDa*

But these forms are not seen in Kannada.
The reason for this (such compound forms without gemination that are valid metrical units not occuring in Kannada) is that,
suffixes like `anu` `ali` are themselves further composed of smaller morphemes `aṁ`/`am̐`/`an`, `al`, `iṁ`/`im̐`/`in`.
Therefore, when the above exampels are examined in more details,
we can see that the `DaDum` pattern indeed forms in the intermediate compound, before disapparing from the proposed hypothetical final compound without epenthetic `w`.
For example,

- `karu + aṁ/an + u => karaṁ/karan (DaDum) + u => karanu (DaDaDa)`
- `paḍu + al + i => paḍal (DaDum) + i => paḍali (DaDaDa)`
- `naḍu + aṇ + a => naḍaṇ (DaDum)+ a => naḍaṇa (DaDaDa)`
- `hasu + in + a => hasin (DaDum) + a => hasina (DaDaDa)`

As seen in the case of gemination [above](#gemination-at-morpheme-boundaries),
it looks like the `DaDum` pattern is avoid even in the intermediate compound forms in Kannada;
not just in the final compound forms.

## Occasional elongation of the short vowel in the initial syllable

We have seen above that an initial `DaDum` pattern can be avoided in compounds by either transforming the initial `light` syllable into a `heavy` syllable by [geminating the following consonant](#gemination-at-morpheme-boundaries)
or by ensuring two `light` initial syllables via the [epenthetic `w`](epenthetic-`w`-found-in-some-case-inflexions).

Let us now examing a third way of avoiding an intial `DaDum` pattern by elongating a `short` vowel in the initial syllable.

It is well known that words like `ondu`, `eraḍu`, `piridu` etc. are substituted by `or`, `ir`, `per` etc. correspondingly, in compunds.
For example,

- `ondu + kaṇṇa => or + kaṇṇa => orkaṇṇa => okkaṇṇa`
- `eraḍu + kaṭṭu => ir + kaṭṭu => irkaṭṭu => ikkaṭṭu`
- `piridu + pāruva => per + pāruva => perbāruva => hebbāra`

But in some compounds, these very same `or`, `ir`, `per`, sometimes appear with the vowel in their first syllable elongated/
For example,

- `ondu + āne => or + āne => ōr + āne => ōrāne` - `o` has elongated to `ō`
- `eraḍu + ēḷu => ir + ēḷu => īr + ēḷu => īrēḷu` - `i` has elongated to `ī`
- `piridu + āne => per + āne => pēr + āne => pērāne => hērānee` - `e` has elongated to `ē`

Here too, the elongation of the vowel in the first syllable, ensures that the first syllable is `heavy`.
If it does not elongate, an initial `DaDum` pattern might manifest.

For example,

- `orāne` - *DaDum*Da
- `irēḷu` - *DaDum*Da
- `perāne/herāne` - *DaDum*Da

Thus, elongation of the vowel in the first syllable also seems to be among the process that help avoid an initial `DaDum` pattern at the beginning of metrical units.

## Initial `DaDum` pattern in verbs

In this discussion of the feature of Kannada language and prosody to avoid an initial `DaDum` pattern in the metrical units,
it must be noted that such initial `DaDum` pattern does indeed appear in verbs.
For example,

- `kaDaṅku` - `DaDumDa`
- `tuḷuṅku` - `DaDumDa`
- `musuṅku` - `DaDumDa`
- `aḍaṅgu` - `DaDumDa`
- `uruḷcu` - `DaDumDa`
- `keraḷcu` - `DaDumDa`
- `bemarcu` - `DaDumDa`
- `muruṇṭu` - `DaDumDa`
- `keraḷda` - `DaDumDa`
- `bemarda` - `DaDumDa`
- `kaṟumbu` - `DaDumDa`

These examples have been selected from the chapter [`dhātuprakaraṇa`](https://archive.org/details/abdamaidarpaa00kirjuoft/page/362/mode/2up) of Kēśirāja's "*śabdamaṇidarpaṇada*".

Such initial `DaDum` patterns in verbs may be explained in two ways.

Firstly, all these examples are from [Old Kannada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Kannada).
These have been transformed into forms without the initial `DaDum` pattern in Modern (even Middle) Kannada.
For example,

- `kalaṅku (DaDumDa) => kalaku (DaDaDa)`
- `tuḷuṅku (DaDumDa) => tuḷuku (DaDaDa)`
- `musuṅku (DaDumDa) => musuku (DaDaDa)`
- `aḍaṅgu (DaDumDa) => aḍagu (DaDaDa)`
- `uruḷcu (DaDumDa) => uruḷisu (DaDaDaDa)`
- `keraḷcu (DaDumDa) => keraḷisu (DaDaDaDa)`
- `bemarcu (DaDumDa) => bevarisu (DaDaDaDa)`
- `muruṇṭu (DaDumDa) => muruṭu (DaDaDa)`
- `keraḷda (DaDumDa) => keraḷida (DaDaDaDa)`
- `bemarda (DaDumDa) => bevarida (DaDaDaDa)`
- `kaṟumbu (DaDumDa) => karubu (DaDaDa)`

It seems like Modern (even Middle) Kannada seems to have extended the scope of the origifnal feature found in Old Kannada of avoiding intial `DaDum` pattern, beyond the nouns, even to the verbs.
The phenomenon of the loss of nasal consonants or nasalisation in these verbs in Modern Kannada is discussed in [A Nose for Nasalisation](A%20Nose%20for%20Nasalisation.md#why-is-nasalisation-not-seen-in-the-dative-case-many-times).
It is perhaps arguable that the extending of the scope of the feature of avoiding initial `DaDum` pattern to verbs in Modern Kannada, might have given an impetus to the process of loss of nasalisation in such cases.

Secondly, verbs are rarely seen at the beginning of sentences.
However, the feature of avoiding a `DaDum` pattern is at the beginning of metrical units, not just at the beginning of sentences.
A sentence might span multiple metrical units.
But it is possible to circumvent the the `DaDum` patterns in the metrical units that come later in the sentence,
by regrouping the words and syllables in such as way that these `DaDum` patterns do not appear at the beginning
of any of those metrical units
(here, the flexibility of stretching and strinking the vowel lengths later in the metrical units comes in handy).
But in nouns, pronouns and their case inflexions that are more likely to appear at the beginning of the sentence than verbs,
it is difficult to circumvent initial `DaDum` pattern if they occur.
So, it may be argued that such initial `DaDum` pattern is tolerated in Old Kannada more in verbs than in nouns and pronouns.

## Initial `DaDum` pattern in the dative case of neuter gender nouns ending with the vowel `a`

In the neuter gender nouns ending with the vowel `a`, since the dative suffix `-ke` is seen with gemination (`-kke`),
if the noun is bisyllabic with only two `light` syllables, the dative form would manifest an initial `DaDum` pattern
in not just Old, but also in Modern Kannada.
For example,

- `marakke` - *DaDum*Da
- `kadakke` - *DaDum*Da

Such cases of initial `DaDum` pattern in nouns is widely used in both the colloquial and written registers of Modern Kannada.
However, in metrical poetry of Old and Modern Kannada, the alternative dative form with the ungeminated variant of the dative suffix (and hence without the initial `DaDum` pattern) is more common.
I.e.,

- `marake` - *DaDaDa*
- `kadake` - *DaDaDa*

The phenomenon of the existence of the variations of dative forms with both geminated and ungeminated variants of the dative suffix is discussed in [A Nose for Nasalisation](A%20Nose%20for%20Nasalisation.md#gemination-sometimes-seen-in-the-dative-case).

### Seemingly unnecessary elongation of the short vowel in the first syllable in some compounds

There are execeptions to the phenomenon of the elongation of the `short` vowel in the first syllable in some compounds
mentioned [above](#occasional-elongation-of-the-short-vowel-in-the-initial-syllable).
For example,

- `piridu + aḍavi => per + aḍavi => pēraḍavi` - even if the vowel remains short (`per`), no initial `DaDum` pattern would manist (`peraḍavi` - `DaDaDaDa`).
- `or + va => ōrva` - even if the first vowel remains short (`or`), no intial `DaDum` pattern would manifest (`orva` - `DumDa`). The word is indeed found in Old Kannada as `orvaṁ`/`orvan` with a `short` vowel.
- `karidu + mugilu => kar + mugilu => kārmugilu` - even if the vowel remains short (`kar`), no initial `DaDum` pattern would manifest (`karmugilu` - `DumDaDaDa`). The word is indeed found in Old Kannada as `karmugil` with a `short` vowel.
- `karidu + mōḍa => kar + mōḍa => kārmōḍa` - even if the vowel remains short (`kar`) , no initial `DaDum` pattern would manifest (`karmōḍa` - `DumDumDa`). The word is indeed found in Old Kannada as `karmōḍa` with a `short` vowel.

Given that there other such exceptions apart from these examples, it must be admitted that these processes have complete scope even in Modern Kannada.

## The ending vowel `u` sometimes added in the nominative forms of some nouns not ending with the vowel `a`

"[Kannaḍa Kaipiḍi](https://archive.org/details/ZeJJ_kannada-kaipidi-kannada-university-of-mysore/mode/1up)"
discusses the phenomenon of the occasional adding of vowel `u` in the nominative forms of some nouns not ending with the vowel `a`.
This is mentioned in [A Nose for Nasalisation](A%20Nose%20for%20Nasalisation.md#kannaḍa-kaipiḍi-page-412).

For example,

- `nadi + u => nadiyu`
- `kere + u => kereyu`
- `hasu + u => hasuvu`

As an alternative to the explanation in the "Kannaḍa Kaipiḍi" that such adding of `u` in the nominative in Modern Kannada
may be due to a misconception that `-u` is a nominative suffix,
another explation could be that this phenomenon is another manifestation of the process of avoiding the
invalid bisyllabic `aṁśagaṇa` metrical units consisting of only two `light` syllables.

For example,

- `nadi` - *DaDa*
- `kere` - *DaDa*
- `hasu` - *DaDa*

When the vowel `u` is added, the process of epenthetic `w` or `y` would transform the word into three light syllables,
which are valid metrical units.

For example,

- `nadi + u => nadiyu` - *DaDaDa*
- `kere + u => kereyu` - *DaDaDa*
- `hasu + u => hasuvu` - *DaDaDa*

Thus, the explanation that the additional `u` for transforming bisyllabic nouns with two `light` syllables
into valid multi-syllable metrical units,
may have become prevalent enough to be used in other cases too (for example, `karaḍiyu`, `bāḷeyu`),
might be an alternative to the explanation in the "Kannaḍa Kaipiḍi" that such adding of `u` may be due to
an misconception that `-u` is a nominative suffix.

## Summary

Thus, the common feature behind the [distinct structure of the metrical units in native Kannada prosody](#structure-of-metrical-units-in-native-kannada-prosody),
the [gemination at morpheme boundaries](#gemination-at-morpheme-boundaries), the [epenthetic `w` in some case inflexions](#occasional-elongation-of-the-short-vowel-in-the-initial-syllable)
and the [occasional elongation of the `short` vowel in the first syllable in compounds](#occasional-elongation-of-the-short-vowel-in-the-initial-syllable),
is the very same feature of avoiding an initial `DaDum` pattern at the beginning of metrical units,
first proposed by Sediyapu Krishna Bhat as, common across the prosody native to the Dravidian family of languages.
Modern Kannada seems to extend the the scope of this feature even to avoid the initial `DaDum` pattern
even in verbs and to some extent even the occurrance of such a pattern in imported metres.
